On the edge of the bed, a boy sat, his hands shaking as he held a piece of dry bread. His eyes were wide, as if he were on high alert, and he barely noticed when I entered.

He looked nervous, almost as if he were preparing to be caught in some embarrassing situation.
 
"Oh, sorry!" he exclaimed, almost dropping the bread on the floor. "I... I didn't know you were going to be here already... uh..." 
  
I stopped, dumbfounded, trying to figure out what was happening. He noticed me, but instead of standing up confidently, he jumped a little, as if trying to avoid being caught in something embarrassing. 

"Are you okay?" I asked. 

He tried to compose himself, a nervous smile on his face, but failed. "Yeah! Sure! Everything's great! I was just... finishing... packing." He paused, as if he didn't know what to say.
