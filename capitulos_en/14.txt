The next morning, when I woke, I noticed everyone was still asleep—except for Drakon, who had already left. I stretched and stepped outside the tent, breathing in the fresh morning air as the gentle warmth of the sun touched my face. After taking some time to survey the camp, I saw Drakon returning from the Viperspire mansion, his expression focused and resolute.

"Ah, up early, Azoth? You should make the most of your rest while you can; our expedition routine is pretty exhausting." Drakon's slight smile held a mix of excitement and determination.

Drakon seemed to have a natural knack for leadership, balancing responsibility with genuine care for the group. His dedication was hard not to respect.

"Thanks, but I had a really good rest today, I'd better use the remaining time preparing." After reflecting for a moment, I asked, "What is the plan for today's expedition?" My voice filled with curiosity.

"Today, we'll be heading to an area in the plains known for its wide variety of monsters," Drakon explained. "With you joining the group, I've decided to shift toward an expedition that focuses more on gathering item drops." He paused, considering the plan in detail. "The only real threat there is the Swift Elder Willow, the strongest monster in the area, though it's still weaker than the Vocal in terms of strength and HP(editar isso). But now there'll be two people to share the aggro, that will allow us to hunt monsters way faster."

Drakon was right. The difference between having one frontline fighter taking all the aggro versus two sharing it was enormous, especially for expeditions in areas like the one we're going for, called prt_fild10 in the game, a dense field where monsters appeared in large numbers. 

The only complication there was the Swift Elder Willow, an aggressive monster that would attack us on sight. However, given the strength of our group, we should be able to take it down with just a slight difficulty.

Drakon roused the group with his infectious energy: "Rise and shine, warriors! Today, we move one step closer to level 20—and Viperspire awaits!" He paused for effect, his voice brimming with anticipation. "Once inside, we won't just survive; we'll make history and claim the guild's greatest triumphs! If you're with me—on your feet, now!"

Kaelyn, still groggy, mumbled, "Why does he always have this much energy first thing in the morning...?"

Elarius, rubbing his eyes, stood up with a groan and muttered near Drakon's ear, "You've got to be kidding. It's not even noon yet..."

Meanwhile, Noctis, after taking a brief look at everytone, simply laid down again and went back to sleep with a sigh, as if nothing had happened.

The others continued their playful banter for a while until everyone finally got up and prepared for the day.

Before we left, Drakon gave me a Linker Ring. I remembered I still had the one I used with Rox—I looked into my inventory to see how it was, but now that it expired, it looked like an ordinary ring; even the color it had before had disappeared.

Walking through the dense jungle of the Prontera Plains, I became lost in thought about the technologies from my old world that could facilitate our exploration here. Sure, the magical portals here were useful, but perhaps they have restricted the advancement of more practical inventions, like cars and trucks, that could speed up our crossing between areas. I imagined what it would be like if we had these vehicles here, cutting through the wild terrain more easily.

Even though this world didn't have the same technology, I felt deeply grateful. It was the same universe that I had explored so many times through the computer screen, but now, I lived in it. I spent my days in the old world in a monotonous and empty routine, immersed in work, anxious about the future and isolated, without friends or family It was like I was trapped in a bubble, where the hours dragged by, and the only interactions I had were with endless lines of code and reports. 

The weight of loneliness followed me, making everything harder. My coworkers were just nameless faces, and the few friends I had had drifted away, each diving into their own busy lives. The lack of human connection made me feel like I was just existing, and not really living. 

Now, it was like I had finally found a purpose, a place where my skills and knowledge really mattered, where I could stand out from the rest. I hope the other Earthlings that came here had the same luck in finding meaning and a better life in this new world.

Reaching a denser part of the jungle, Drakon raised his hand, signaling us to stop. "A few more steps and we will be in zone 10 of the Prontera Plains," he said, turning to us with a serious look. "Before entering, let's review our plan."

Everyone gathered, listening intently as he began. "First off, this is my first time in this zone," he said. "We need to stay alert—there are far more monsters here than in the earlier areas. We'll keep close to the border so we can fall back if necessary. Azoth and I will take the front line. Elarius and Noctis, stay right behind us and be ready to engage from mid-range. Kaelyn, you'll cover us from the rear with support and watch for any ambushes from behind."

He had a block placement plan, but for me, the key was in effectively utilizing each person's skills. Before we went in, I approached Kaelyn and asked, "Kaelyn, can you tell me about your skills?"

Kaelyn raised an eyebrow at the sudden question, but responded with a soft smile. "I have Blessing, Increase Agility and Heal."

"That's nice. Thanks." I replied, pleased to know we would have such helpful support skills. I returned to my position, eager to get started.

As soon as we entered the area, the first monster appeared – a Poporing, basically a green Poring. It was a good target for warming up. Drakon advanced first, delivering a powerful blow with his sword, causing considerable damage to the monster. His strength was impressive, and as a swordsman, he had the highest HP of the group, making him ideal for opening combat and attracting the monster's attention.

I quickly moved forward and attacked, hitting Poporing with my sword. The blow, however, didn't cause much damage. That made me realize how much weaker I was compared to Drakon. I took a deep breath, raised my shield and prepared myself for any counterattack.

Now it was Elarius's turn, our Wizard, who unleashed a spiritual attack—a simple yet effective spell that consumed no mana. The Poporing was struck again, trembling slightly before regaining its composure. I knew these small skirmishes were just the beginning, but I already felt fully immersed in the battle. Fighting stronger monsters in a bigger group was way more appealing. I can't wait to have Rox to join us, if all goes right.

Kaelyn had just cast Divine Protection, a passive skill that created a faint glowing aura around us, strengthening our defense without consuming any mana (só uma dúvida. faz setense ela ficar usando buffs assim? esse monstro é fraco, não? ela gasta alguma coisa?). 

As the soft glow began to dissipate, Noctis, the agile thief, advanced like a shadow. With a swift movement, he attacked the Poporing with his dagger. The monster barely had time to react; it attempted to counterattack Drakon, but the swordsman, encased in his robust armor, hardly felt the impact. In response, Drakon delivered a powerful blow, leaving the Poporing in pieces. We all felt the wave of experience wash over us, distributed among the group.

We continued to encounter more Poporings in the area. They were the most common monsters at the borders, and we defeated around 40 of them before Drakon, pleased with our progress, turned to the group. "Now that we’ve warmed up, it's time to venture deeper into Zone 10. Let's seek out stronger monsters."

After walking for a while, we spotted a group of Cocos, small creatures resembling foxes with orange fur. Kaelyn couldn't contain her excitement: "Look how cute they are, guys!" Drakon, however, didn't comment and simply went on the offensive. 

The Cocos were a bit tougher than the Poporings, but we still managed to defeat them with relative ease. We took advantage of the abundant numbers of these monsters to hone our skills and accumulate experience. After taking down several Cocos, I reached level 17.

At that moment, Drakon was the strongest among us, at level 19, followed by Elarius at level 18, while Kaelyn, Noctis, and I had all reached level 17. Along the way, Drakon reassured us that he would keep pushing until everyone reached level 20 and expressed his desire for the group to remain together even after we all joined Viperspire.

After defeating around 40 Cocos, we faced a new challenge: the Horns. Drakon was particularly excited about the possibility of them dropping a rare weapon, the Guisarme, and we committed ourselves to battling countless Horns, hoping for good fortune. However, after taking down 50 of them, they didn’t drop any, leaving us feeling disappointed. (mas foi o protagonista que não conseguiu o guisarme, ou ninguém do grupo conseguiu?)

We continued our exploration until we reached the territory of the Elder Willows, the monster we were looking for. Defeating an Elder Willow wouldn't be easy; As creatures made of wood, our weapons wore out quickly with each blow, which could lead to complications in the future. Even so, we faced several Elder Willows, and I was lucky enough to get two level 3 Fire Bolt skill scrolls dropped into my inventory through the Linker Ring.

These scrolls were single use but allowed me to instantly cast Fire Bolt, and I found myself imagining the possibilities. If skill scrolls from other classes were common, perhaps there would be a way to craft them. The potential to profit from cross-class abilities, available through scrolls, was tempting and could change the dynamics of combat.

While analyzing my new items, I noticed Drakon closely observing something from behind a bush. Curious, I approached, trying to be silent. Upon noticing my presence, he motioned for me not to make any noise and whispered: "Shh, look over there…" Drakon had an expression of excitement and nervousness, as if we had discovered a treasure.

It was the Swift Elder Willow, a rarer and more agile variant of the Elder Willow, with a sturdy, ominous presence, as if waiting for the right moment to strike. Unable to contain his excitement, Drakon called out to the group, his voice booming: "There lies our prize!" His shout echoed through the area as the team rushed into battle, some chuckling at his unorthodox enthusiasm (não dava pra metele um ataque surpresa? ele tinha mesmo que anunciar com um grito?).

However, what Drakon didn't realize was that there was another Swift Elder Willow hidden to our left. When everyone was ready to attack, we noticed the second creature emerging from the shadows (era melhor o segundo aparecer no meio da batalha com o primeiro). The blood ran cold in my veins, and I felt the same tension spread throughout the group. In an instant, the Swift Elder Willows gave us a predatory glare and rushed forward aggressively, forcing us to fight with all our might.
