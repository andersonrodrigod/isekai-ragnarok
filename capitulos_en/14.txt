The next morning, when I woke, I noticed everyone was still asleep—except for Drakon, who had already left. I stretched and stepped outside the tent, breathing in the fresh morning air as the gentle warmth of the sun touched my face. After taking some time to survey the camp, I saw Drakon returning from the Viperspire mansion, his expression focused and resolute.

"Ah, up early, Azoth? You should make the most of your rest while you can; our expedition routine is pretty exhausting." Drakon's slight smile held a mix of excitement and determination.

Drakon seemed to have a natural knack for leadership, balancing responsibility with genuine care for the group. His dedication was hard not to respect.

"Thanks, but I had a really good rest today, I'd better use the remaining time preparing." After reflecting for a moment, I asked, "What is the plan for today's expedition?" My voice filled with curiosity.

"Today, we'll be heading to an area in the plains known for its wide variety of monsters," Drakon explained. "With you joining the group, I've decided to shift toward an expedition that focuses more on gathering item drops." He paused, considering the plan in detail. "The only real threat there is the Swift Elder Willow, the strongest monster in the area, though it's still weaker than the Vocal in terms of strength and HP(editar isso). But now there'll be two people to share the aggro, that will allow us to hunt monsters way faster."

Drakon was right. The difference between having one frontline fighter taking all the aggro versus two sharing it was enormous, especially for expeditions in areas like the one we're going for, called prt_fild10 in the game, a dense field where monsters appeared in large numbers. 

The only complication there was the Swift Elder Willow, an aggressive monster that would attack us on sight. However, given the strength of our group, we should be able to take it down with just a slight difficulty.

Drakon roused the group with his infectious energy: "Rise and shine, warriors! Today, we move one step closer to level 20—and Viperspire awaits!" He paused for effect, his voice brimming with anticipation. "Once inside, we won't just survive; we'll make history and claim the guild's greatest triumphs! If you're with me - on your feet, now!"

Kaelyn, still groggy, mumbled, "Why does he always have this much energy first thing in the morning...?"

Elarius, rubbing her eyes, stood up with a groan and muttered near Drakon's ear, "You've got to be kidding. It's not even noon yet.,,"

Meanwhile, Noctis, after taking a brief look at everytone, simply laid down again and went back to sleep with a sigh, as if nothing had happened.

(transição aqui tá mt súbita. um paragrafo eles tão fazendo cu doce pra acordar, e no outro eles já sairam; tirei a parte q a mina chama o captão de imbecil. mt desrespeitoso >>>> beleza mas eu num mencionei que ele chamou de imbecil não estranho e outra ele não é o capitão ele só formou esse grupo e o pessoaç o considera líder)

Before we left, Drakon gave me a Linker Ring [adição >>> The same item I used with Rox to share the experience, I looked in my inventory to see how it was, but now it just looked like an ordinary ring; even the color it had before had disappeared.](tu esqueceu de mencionar quando o linker ring dele expirou >>> mas o Drakon deu o anel pra ele lá ele, esse anel que ele recebe é novo mas realmente me esqueci ), a special ring that allowed you to share items and experience with the group. "With this, we will be able to better balance our resources," he said, as he adjusted his sword (menciona aqui agora sobre o linker ring antigo).

Walking through the dense jungle of the Prontera Plains, I became lost in thoughts about the technologies from my old world that could facilitate our exploration here. Sure, the magical portals here were useful, but perhaps they have restricted the advancement of more practical inventions, like cars and trucks, that could speed up our crossing between areas. I imagined what it would be like if we had these vehicles here, cutting through the wild terrain more easily.

Even though this world didn't have the same technology, I felt deeply grateful. It was the same universe that I had explored so many times through the computer screen , but now, I lived it. I spent my days in the old world in a monotonous and empty routine, immersed in work, anxious about the future and isolated, without friends or family It was like I was trapped in a bubble, where the hours dragged by, and the only interactions I had were with endless lines of code and reports. The weight of loneliness followed me, making everything even harder. My coworkers were just nameless faces, and the few friends I had had drifted away, each diving into their own busy lives. The lack of human connection made me feel like I was just existing, and not really living. (bom justificar o porque de ele não ter amigos ou família, se tu conseguir pensar em um motivo bom  >>> adicionei o resto que você pediu dividi o parágrafo de baixo pra nao ficar grande). 

Now, it was like I had finally found a purpose, a place where my skills and knowledge really mattered, where I could stand out from the rest. I hoped that other Earthlings, if they were here, would have the same luck in finding meaning and a better life in this new world. (mantem os parenteses, vou ter q editar isso dps)

Reaching a denser part of the jungle, Drakon raised his hand, signaling us to stop. "A few more steps and we will be in zone 10 of the Prontera Plains," he said, turning to us with a serious look. "Before entering, let's review our plan."

Everyone gathered, listening closely as he spoke. "This is my first time in this zone," he began. "We need to stay sharp since there are far more monsters here than in the earlier areas. We'll stick close to the border so we can fall back if needed. Azoth and I will take the front line. Elarius and Noctis, stay right behind us, ready to engage from mid-range. Kaelyn, you'll cover us from the rear with support, and also pay attention to our back for ambushes."

He had a block placement plan, but for me, the key was in effectively utilizing each person's skills. Before we went in, I approached Kaelyn and asked, 'What are your skills? (mantem vou editar dps >> eu mudei completamente o parágrafo pra não ficar gay)

Kaelyn raised an eyebrow, surprised by the direct question, but responded with a soft smile. "I have Blessing, Increase Agility and Heal." (mantem)

"Thank you, Kaelyn," I replied, pleased to know we would have someone with such helpful support skills. I returned to my position, eager to get started. (mantem)

As soon as we entered the area, the first monster appeared – a Poporing, basically a green Poring. It was a good target for warming up. Drakon advanced first, delivering a powerful blow with his sword, causing considerable damage to the monster. His strength was impressive, and as a swordsman, he had the highest HP of the group, making him ideal for opening combat and attracting the monster's attention.

I quickly moved forward and attacked, hitting Poporing with my sword. The blow, however, didn't cause much damage. I was a little disappointed, but I noticed the group's encouraging looks, as if they wanted to tell me that I still had a lot to do (meio gay isso, prrotagonista parecendo mulher precisando de conforto). show. I took a deep breath, raised my shield and prepared myself for any counterattack.

Now it was the turn of Elarius (mantem, procurr pronome feminino), our wizard, who launched a spiritual attack – a simple but effective spell that consumed no mana. The Poporing was hit again, trembling slightly before composing itself. I knew these small clashes were just the beginning, but I already felt immersed in the battle. Each blow, each strategy (que estratégia? tu tá falando como se tivesse alguma estratégia complexa >>> tira a parte que ele citou a estratégia isso é coisa do chat gpt) made the feeling of finally living what, for so long, had been just a dream grow.

Kaelyn had just cast Divine Protection, a passive skill that created a faint glowing aura around us, strengthening our defense without spending mana. While the soft glow was still dissipating, Noctis, the agile thief, advanced like a shadow. With one movement Precise and swift, he attacked the Poporing with his dagger. The monster barely had time to react; he tried to counterattack Drakon, but the swordsman, with his robust armor, barely felt the impact. In response, Drakon struck a powerful blow, leaving. the Poporing to pieces. We all felt the wave of experience being distributed among us." (mantem improve)

We continue to face more Poporings around the area. It was the creature that appeared most frequently in the surface zones, and we defeated about 40 of them before Drakon, satisfied with our progress, turned to the group. "Now that we've warmed up, it's time to go deeper into Zone 10. Let's go in search of stronger monsters."

After walking for a while, we saw a group of Cocos, small creatures that resembled foxes with orange fur. Kaelyn couldn't contain her excitement: "Look how cute they are, guys!" But Drakon, focused as always, started the fight. The Cocos were a little tougher than the Poporings, but we were still able to defeat them with relative ease. We take advantage of the abundant number of these creatures to improve our skills and accumulate experience. After defeating several Coconuts, I reached level 17.

At that moment, Drakon was the strongest among us, being at level 19, followed by Elarius at level 18, while Kaelyn, Noctis and I had reached level 17. Along the way, Drakon shared his goal of helping us reach level 20, reinforcing that he wanted to form a united group, even within the Viperspire Guild (isso aqui soou redundante ee esquisito >> tu ajeita ).

After defeating around 40 Coconuts, we encountered a new challenge: the Horns. Drakon was especially excited about the possibility of dropping a rare weapon, the Guisarme, and we committed ourselves to facing countless Horns, trying our luck. However, after defeating 50 of them, discouragement began to take its toll (como assim?), and for the first time I felt discouraged at not having gotten the weapon I so desired (q viadagem é essa?).

We continued our exploration until we reached the territory of the Elder Willows, the type of monster we were looking for. Defeating an Elder Willow wouldn't be easy; As creatures made of wood, our weapons wore out quickly with each blow, which could lead to complications in the future. Even so, we faced several Elder Willows, and I was lucky enough to drop two level 3 Fire Bolt skill scrolls.

These scrolls allowed me to instantly cast Fire Bolt, and I found myself imagining the possibilities. If skill scrolls from other classes were common, perhaps there would be a way to craft them. The potential to profit from cross-class abilities, available through scrolls, was tempting and could change the dynamics of combat (o protagonista tem algum motivo pra acreditar que isso é possível?).

While analyzing my new items, I noticed Drakon closely observing something from behind a bush. Curious, I approached, trying to be silent. Upon noticing my presence, he motioned for me not to make any noise and whispered: "Shh, look over there…" Drakon had an expression of excitement and nervousness, as if we had discovered a treasure.

It was the Swift Elder Willow, a rarer and more agile variant of the Elder Willow, with a sturdy, ominous presence, as if waiting for the right moment to strike. Unable to contain his excitement, Drakon called out to the group, his voice booming: "There lies our prize!" His shout echoed through the area as the team rushed into battle, some chuckling at his unorthodox enthusiasm.

However, what Drakon didn't realize was that there was another Swift Elder Willow hidden to our left. When everyone was ready to attack, we noticed the second creature emerging from the shadows (era melhor o segundo aparecer no meio da batalha com o primeiro). The blood ran cold in my veins, and I felt the same tension spread throughout the group. In an instant, the Swift Elder Willows gave us a predatory glare and rushed forward aggressively, forcing us to fight with all our might.
