The next morning, when I woke up, I realized that everyone was still sleeping, except Drakon, who had left early. I stretched, took in the fresh air, and stretched my arms outside the tent, feeling the gentle warmth of the morning sun reflect on my face. I shielded my eyes with my hand to better see the camp around me. When I finally left the tent, I saw Drakon returning from the Viperspire mansion with a determined expression.

“Ah, did you wake up early, Azoth? Take the opportunity to rest as much as you can, because later we will venture into the densest part of the jungle on the Prontea plains.” Drakon gave a slight smile, a mixture of enthusiasm and seriousness.

Drakon really seemed like a natural leader, always showing consideration and attention to the group. He had a sense of responsibility, guided us with confidence and ensured that each person performed their role safely and efficiently. It was impossible not to admire his attitude and commitment.

After reflecting for a moment, I asked, “And what is the plan for today’s expedition?” My voice carried attentive curiosity.

“Today, we are going to an area in the plains where there are a wide variety of monsters. With you in the group, we have the chance to also focus on item drops.” He paused strategically, planning every detail in his mind. “The only real threat we will face there is the Swift Elder Willow. It is the strongest monster in that area, however it is a weaker monster than Vocal in terms of strength and HP. But now, with you, we can share the aggro. My idea is that we take turns dealing damage, and this way, we can face more monsters, gain experience and progress in level.”

Drakon's plan was solid. With five of us, we could focus on quick battles, defeating monsters en masse to accumulate experience. This area, in the game, was prt_fild10, a dense field where monsters appeared in large numbers. The only complication was the Swift Elder Willow, an aggressive enemy that would attack us on sight. But with teamwork, we could beat him in just a few turns. I agreed with the plan, seeing the opportunity to evolve more quickly.

Drakon then woke everyone up with his inspiring energy: “Come on, warriors! Today is our glory day! One step closer to reaching level 20 and entering Viperspire!” he took a short pause and continued "When we enter Viperspire, we will make history and achieve the guild's greatest achievements! Whoever is with me, stand up now!"

Kaelyn, still drowsy, muttered softly: “This Drakon gets too excited, there’s a lot of excitement early on…”

Elarius, with her eyes half closed, stood up abruptly and shouted in Drakon's ear: “Are you crazy, you imbecile?! It’s not even noon!”

Meanwhile, Noctis, after observing the chaotic situation, simply lay down again and went back to sleep with a sigh, as if nothing had happened.

Before we left, Drakon gave me a Linker Ring, a special ring that allowed you to share items and experience with the group. “With this, we will be able to better balance our resources,” he said, as he adjusted his sword.

Walking through the dense jungle of the Prontera Plains, I became lost in thoughts about the technologies from my old world that could facilitate our exploration here. Sure, the magical portals here were useful, but perhaps they would have restricted the advancement of more practical inventions, like cars and motorbikes, that could speed up our crossing between areas. I imagined what it would be like if we had these vehicles here, cutting through the wild terrain more easily and safely.

Even though this world didn't have the same technology, I felt deeply grateful. It was the same universe that I had explored so many times through the computer screen, but now, I lived it. I spent my days in the old world in a monotonous and empty routine, immersed in work and isolated, without friends or family. Now, it was like I had finally found a purpose, a place where my skills and knowledge really mattered. I hoped that other Earthlings, if they were here, would have the same luck in finding meaning and a better life in this new world.

Reaching a denser part of the jungle, Drakon raised his hand, signaling us to stop. “A few more steps and we will be in zone 10 of the Prontera Plains,” he said, turning to us with a serious look. “Before entering, let’s review the strategy.”

Everyone approached, paying attention to what he had to say. “This is the first time I’ve been in this zone,” he began. “So we need to be careful. From here, the number of monsters increases a lot compared to previous areas. We will stay close to the border, where we can retreat if necessary. Me and Azoth will be the front line. Elarius and Noctis will stay close behind, ready to attack from medium range, and Kaelyn will support us from the rear.”

I liked the plan, it seemed well balanced. The key, however, would be the effective use of each person's skills. Before we went in, I approached Kaelyn and asked, “What skills do you have?”

Kaelyn raised an eyebrow, surprised by the direct question, but responded with a soft smile. “I have Blessing, Increase Agility and Heal.”

“Thank you, Kaelyn,” I replied, pleased to know we would have someone with such helpful support skills. I returned to my position, eager to get started.

As soon as we entered the area, the first monster appeared – a Poporing, basically a green Poring. It was a good target for warming up. Drakon advanced first, delivering a powerful blow with his sword, causing considerable damage to the monster. His strength was impressive, and as a swordsman, he had the highest HP of the group, making him ideal for opening combat and attracting the monster's attention.

"I quickly moved forward and attacked, hitting Poporing with my sword. The blow, however, didn't cause much impact. I was a little disappointed, but I noticed the group's encouraging looks, as if they wanted to tell me that I still had a lot to do. show. I took a deep breath, raised my shield and prepared myself for any counterattack."

Now it was the turn of Elarius, our wizard, who launched a spiritual attack – a simple but effective spell that consumed no mana. The Poporing was hit again, trembling slightly before composing itself. I knew these small clashes were just the beginning, but I already felt immersed in the battle. Each blow, each strategy made the feeling of finally living what, for so long, had been just a dream grow.

"Kaelyn had just cast Divine Protection, a passive skill that created a faint glowing aura around us, strengthening our defense without spending mana. While the soft glow was still dissipating, Noctis, the agile thief, advanced like a shadow. With one movement Precise and swift, he attacked the Poporing with his dagger. The monster barely had time to react; he tried to counterattack Drakon, but the swordsman, with his robust armor, barely felt the impact. In response, Drakon struck a powerful blow, leaving. the Poporing to pieces. We all felt the wave of experience being distributed among us."

We continue to face more Poporings around the area. It was the creature that appeared most frequently in the surface zones, and we defeated about 40 of them before Drakon, satisfied with our progress, turned to the group. “Now that we've warmed up, it's time to go deeper into Zone 10. Let's go in search of stronger monsters.”

After walking for a while, we saw a group of Cocos, small creatures that resembled foxes with orange fur. Kaelyn couldn’t contain her excitement: “Look how cute they are, guys!” But Drakon, focused as always, started the fight. The Cocos were a little tougher than the Poporings, but we were still able to defeat them with relative ease. We take advantage of the abundant number of these creatures to improve our skills and accumulate experience. After defeating several Coconuts, I reached level 17.

At that moment, Drakon was the strongest among us, being at level 19, followed by Elarius at level 18, while Kaelyn, Noctis and I had reached level 17. Along the way, Drakon shared his goal of helping us reach level 20, reinforcing that he wanted to form a united group, even within the Viperspire Guild.

After defeating around 40 Coconuts, we encountered a new challenge: the Horns. Drakon was especially excited about the possibility of dropping a rare weapon, the Guisarme, and we committed ourselves to facing countless Horns, trying our luck. However, after defeating 50 of them, discouragement began to take its toll, and for the first time I felt discouraged at not having gotten the weapon I so desired.

We continued our exploration until we reached the territory of the Elder Willows, the type of monster we were looking for. Defeating an Elder Willow wouldn't be easy; As creatures made of wood, our weapons wore out quickly with each blow, which could lead to complications in the future. Even so, we faced several Elder Willows, and I was lucky enough to drop two level 3 Fire Bolt skill scrolls.

These scrolls allowed me to instantly cast Fire Bolt, and I found myself imagining the possibilities. If skill scrolls from other classes were common, perhaps there would be a way to craft them. The potential to profit from cross-class abilities, available through scrolls, was tempting and could change the dynamics of combat.

While analyzing my new items, I noticed Drakon closely observing something from behind a bush. Curious, I approached, trying to be silent. Upon noticing my presence, he motioned for me not to make any noise and whispered: “Shh, look over there…” Drakon had an expression of excitement and nervousness, as if we had discovered a treasure.

It was the Swift Elder Willow, a rarer and more agile version of the Elder Willow, with a robust and menacing appearance, as if it was awaiting something. Drakon, too excited to remain calm, shouted to the group, calling them into battle: “There lies our enemy!” His voice echoed across the area, and everyone ran to join the fight, some laughing at Drakon's somewhat unusual manner.

However, what Drakon didn't realize was that there was another Swift Elder Willow hidden to our left. When everyone was ready to attack, we noticed the second creature emerging from the shadows. The blood ran cold in my veins, and I felt the same tension spread throughout the group. In an instant, the Swift Elder Willows gave us a predatory glare and rushed forward aggressively, forcing us to fight with all our might.
