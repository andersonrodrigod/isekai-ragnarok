1. On the edge of the bed, a boy sat, his hands shaking as he held a piece of dry bread. His eyes were wide, like he was on high alert, and he barely noticed when I entered.

2. He appeared to be nervous, almost as if he was preparing to be caught in some awkward situation.

3. "Oh, sorry!" he exclaimed, almost dropping the bread on the floor. "I... I didn't know you were going to arrive... yeah..."

4. I stopped, dumbfounded, trying to understand what was happening. He noticed my presence, but instead of standing up confidently, he gave a little jump, as if trying to avoid getting caught in something embarrassing.

5. "Are you okay?" I asked.

6. He tried to compose himself, with a nervous smile on his face, but failed. "Yes! Of course! Everything's great! I was just… finishing… packing things up." He paused, as if he didn't know what to say.

7. "So... you're my roommate, right?" I asked, still a little confused.

8. "That's right! I'm Rox, Rox Solis. Nice to meet you!" He stood up quickly, almost tripping over a chair that was half overturned. When he straightened up, he reached out his hand, but just as he tried to get closer, he remembered something and took a step back, clearly uncomfortable.

9. "Solis..." I thought, as if that surname was familiar to me. It was as if I had heard that name somewhere, perhaps in some story or even in research on Earth. But no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't remember exactly where. The feeling of familiarity never left me.

10. "Are you okay, Rox?" I asked, trying to understand if he was scared or just like that.

11. "Ah, it's just... one thing, it's... I'm kind of... nervous about change, you know? Change of environment, new people... that sort of thing." He took a deep breath, as if preparing to face an invisible monster.

12. "But we're going to do our best, right? It's going to be smooth! I promise!", said Rox

13. The scene was so unusual that I couldn't help but laugh. Rox looked like he was getting ready to face a dragon, but all he had to do was share a room with me.

14. He smiled, still adjusting the bed, and seemed to have calmed down a little. After a few seconds, he raised his head and, with a shy smile, said: "Ah, by the way... you must be wondering what I'm doing here, right?" He chuckled nervously, trying to break the tense atmosphere. "Well, actually... I'm an adventurer."

15. I looked at him for a moment, surprise giving way to a smile. Rox, with his clumsy ways, didn't seem like the kind of person you'd expect to meet in the world of adventures, but something told me he'd be great company to tackle some dungeons with. "Rox, What level are you now?"

16. "I'm level 6," Rox said, a little embarrassed.

17. "Do you plan to explore any dungeons tomorrow?" I asked casually.

18. "Yes, tomorrow I'm going to the adventurers' guild. I hope to find a companion to do some quest... But why do you ask?", he replied, curious.

19. "You're an otherworlder, aren't you?" I asked, using the term that inhabitants of that world often use to describe people from other worlds.

20. Rox looked at me, surprised, and gave a nervous laugh. "Yes, I am, but not like I'm an ET or something. I'm a human, just like you." He scratched the back of his neck, trying to look at ease.

21. I smiled internally. He fell right into my move. Rox thought I was a native inhabitant of this world, and not someone like him. Right now, he doesn't need to know the truth. Maybe I wouldn't trust myself enough to take advice if I knew we were the same.

22. "Then it's decided! I'll go explore a dungeon with you!" – I clapped my hands together, with a confident smile on my face.

23. "Wait, are you an adventurer too?" – Rox asked, excited.

24. "Yes, I'm at level 6 too. I hope we get along well on this journey", I replied with a positive gesture, trying to reinforce confidence.

25. ...

26. The next morning, we woke up early and went straight to the adventurers' guild. Upon arrival, Rose, as usual, was there to welcome us. I greeted her and introduced Rox as my new exploring companion.

27. "So, since it's your first time in a dungeon, I'm going to need to explain how everything works," said Rose, with a serious but friendly tone.

28. In the world of Ragnarok, mana is an arcane energy that permeates the entire environment, being responsible for countless magical phenomena, including the creation of monsters. Just like in Earth physics where energy converts into atoms to form the basis of all matter, in Ragnarok, mana plays a similar role by organizing and condensing energy into tangible, often living forms.

29. The concentration of mana at certain areas we call warps, creates a phenomenon known as "Magic Crystallization", where raw energy begins to transform into physical matter. This process is slow but continuous, making mana go from a "magical essence" to complex organisms – monsters.

30. At the end of Rose's explanation, she adds an even more intriguing detail about mana accumulation and its consequences:

31. Rose sighed, as if revealing a secret known only to the most experienced. "In addition to the monsters that spawn naturally in warps," she began, "there is something even rarer and more dangerous that can happen when the amount of mana in an area becomes out of control or exceeds its natural limit."

32. She paused for a moment, letting the tension hang in the air. "In situations where there is an overflow of mana, the excess of this concentrated energy manifests itself in a more extreme way. This is when a Great Dungeon begins to form. These dungeons are immense and have an unknown number of floors, making them a real challenge."

33. "These dungeons," she continued, "appear once or twice a year, often in the Kingdom of Rune-Midgard, and are a phenomenon that attracts adventurers from all corners. That's because within these dungeons, the rewards are incomparable. The monsters that inhabit these places, including the Big Boss that rules the deepest floors, drop rare items at an absurdly higher rate. For adventurers, these dungeons are a unique opportunity to get rich and obtain items that would otherwise be impossible to find. anywhere else."

34. "Of course," she smirked, "entering one of these dungeons is as dangerous as it is rewarding. Many enter and never return. Each floor brings challenges that no one can predict, and the Bosses that guard the deeper floors. .. well, few survived to tell their stories."

35. "Speaking of which," Rose continued, "the last Great Dungeon came out about three months ago, and no one could advance in it. For a month and a half, several guilds tried and failed to defeat the final Boss. It was then that the Guild Stormlords, realizing the difficulty, decided to act. They allied with two more powerful guilds and, together, managed to finish the dungeon."

36. "So, it was necessary for them to organize themselves to explore and clear that dungeon?"

37. Rose nodded. "Yes, but this dugeon was not by far the one that lasted the longest. I have heard of dugeons that took more than 5 years to be completed."

38. Rox's eyes sparkled with admiration. "Stormlords... They really are amazing. One day... one day I want to be a part of them."

39. Rose smiled when she saw Rox's determination. "Well, for that, you're going to need a lot of strength and courage. So, how about exploring a warp on the outskirts of Prontera?"

40. When she mentioned the surroundings of Prontera, a doubt arose in my mind. "Can we go to Prontera?"

41. Rose continued, as if she had read my thoughts: "That region where a gigantic jungle is located is where many low-level monsters live. That's where most new adventurers begin their journey."

42. I found myself thinking for a moment, trying to understand how we could get to Prontera. Walking there seemed like an impossible mission, it would take days.

43. "But how do we get there?" I asked, raising the doubt that was bouncing around in my head.

44. Rose looked at me and explained in a calm tone, as if this were a common answer: "You can get to Prontera, yes. But the problem is that getting into the city won't be easy."

45. "Why?" I asked, curious.

46. ​​"Prontera is controlled by a powerful oligarchy. To enter, you need to pay 10 thousand zenys. It is a rich city, very rich indeed. There are rumors that most otherworlders were expelled from there, being sent to other cities in the kingdom ...Or even to the Republic of Schwartzvald."

47. The high rate made me stop to reflect on the reality of that place. It was evident that, in some places, otherworlders were being discriminated against. The lives of those who did not have in-depth knowledge of this world seemed to be full of obstacles, as if we were always at a disadvantage. However, if all Earthlings, like me, came here, it is possible that we will end up becoming the majority. In this case, the balance of power can change, balancing the situation between those who already have total control over this world and the newcomers and those who can cause the greatest change are those who have the greatest knowledge of this world.

48. "And if we manage to get to the outskirts of Prontera, how will we get back?" I asked, with even more doubts in my mind.

49. Rose smiled slightly, noticing my confusion. "Well, on the outskirts of Prontera, near the villages, there are several adventurer camps. And most importantly, there are Portal Watchers there. They control portals that take you to every city in Rune Midgard."

50. 'This was news to me. Those camps and villages? They never existed when I played. But it looks like the game has had a lot of updates while I've been away. I didn't play enough to keep up with everything that changed.'

51. "What are the quests in the jungle of Prontera?" I asked Rose, curious.

52. "Well, if you're looking for quests, the adventurer's guide at the camp there can help you. He has some quests related to the surrounding area. Here, at the guild, we only have quests that are more focused on our city, and there are generally few options. The most interesting ones, so to speak, are deeper into the jungle of Prontera, and are of rank D or C."

53. After hearing Rose's response, I said goodbye and headed towards the Portal Watchers, ready to venture into the plains around Prontera.
