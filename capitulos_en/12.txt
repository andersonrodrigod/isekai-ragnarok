1. After eliminating ten Savage Babes, I chose to ignore most of the Rockers around me. However, upon spotting an Elusive Rocker, the opportunity presented itself and I couldn't let it slip away. Even though the search for the monster took time, as there would be only three in this zone at a time, I thought the risk was worth it, as this enemy promised a good amount of experience and I had already just leveled up to level 15.

2. The Elusive Rocker stood out compared to the other monsters, with a fierce look and a defiant posture. Despite it being stronger than Rockers, I was confident I could beat it. With a quick movement, I prepared my sword and advanced, delivering the first attack. The impact made the monster thrash for an instant, and the battle began.

3. I advanced again with a clear blow, cutting the air with my sword and hitting the monster's body. He reacted with a roar of rage, and then lunged forward, his sharp claws seeking a vulnerable spot. I felt the pressure build as the Elusive Rocker attacked me, its claws tearing through my armor and causing considerable damage. The power of its attack made me hesitate for a moment, but I maintained my focus. I knew I couldn't waver; I just needed to keep fighting.

5. Every blow I struck seemed to cut not only at his energy but also at his resolve (o monstro sente medo ou algo do tipo?). However, with each of its blows, a wave of pain coursed through my body. Its very sharp claws scraped the skin in some places, making me feel the burn of battle. Blocking its attacks with my shield wouldn't always negate all of the damage. I focused on staying calm through the pain and on keeping the fight under control. I knew my opponent was getting worn out, and that certainty drove me to keep attacking.

6. Finally, after one last precise strike, the Elusive Rocker fell, its eyes losing their glow as its body disintegrated into motes of light. I felt neither relief nor euphoria; just the satisfaction of another battle won. The battle wounds burned, but the pain was a reminder that I was alive. As the experience I so sought accumulated, I prepared to continue, absorbing everything I had learned in that fight.

7. It was the first tough fight I had, and an alert went up in my head. The monster managed to inflict 196 damage on me and damaged my armor a little. Although the Formal Suit was cheap and offered good defense stats, its durability left something to be desired. I could refine it, but I didn't intend to waste time improving a useless beginner's equipment; I needed to find more valuable items for my journey.

8. With the victory over the Elusive Rocker, I gained 870 experience, bringing my total to 1401. Now, I was 1650 points short of reaching level 16. However, I still only had 139 HP left, and the idea of ​​facing the Rocker, With its 155 HP, it made me afraid. He could still cause damage that could further reduce my health. Therefore, I decided to spend the rest of the day killing Savage Babes, planning to change my strategy for monster hunting the next day.

9. After eliminating 15 more Savage Babes, totaling 25 for the day, I reached level 16, regaining all my health, and was about to leave zone 5 of the Prontera Plains when another Elusive Rocker appeared again. I couldn't miss this opportunity to fight it.

10. It was getting pretty late, but I felt I still had enough time to defeat it before it gets dark. I started the battle with a strong attack, and it went a bit better than the last one, with the monster attacking mercilessly, but once again I managed to stand my ground, using my high defense to my advantage and attacking when there was an opening.

10.1 I decided I was done for the day after that fight, and started going back to the camp. Suddenly, as I approached the edge of the zone, I came face to face with a Vocal. As soon as it saw me, it started chasing me frantically. I was forced to change directions and started running in the opposite direction. 'Not a good time to stumble upon a Vocal...' I thought, frustrated, as I accelerated.

10.2 Even with a few wounds, I managed to lose it after a while. However, it was already late, and returning the same way was not an option — he could be lurking at any point. So I decided to take a longer, safer route.

10.3 Night had already fallen, and all the light I had came from the crescent moon in the sky, and it wasn't very helpful; I had to advance cautiously. Each step was tread carefully, as any sound could attract monsters in the darkness.

11. With my heart racing and my wounds still fresh, I hurried towards the camp, but the darkness enveloped everything before I could get there, plunging me into an oppressive darkness.

12. I kept running in the dark, barely able to see my surroundings, until my greatest fear at that moment came true. The piercing sound of a roar echoed through the forest: another Vocal. When our eyes met, I didn't think twice and started running.

15. The monster started crazily chasing me, its presence overwhelming in the darkness. I ran as fast as I could, but the low visibility slowed me, making it hard to lose the Vocal. By now I didn't have any idea about the direction I was running toward. Amidst growing despair, a towering cliff blocked my path, too steep to even consider climbing it up. I was cornered. There was no other choice but to fight.

16. I knew my chances against Vocal were almost non-existent, but I couldn't give up without trying. I drew my sword and held my shield tightly, preparing to repel the first attack and perhaps find an opening to flee. The monster advanced with power, the impact of its blow threw me back violently. I felt the blow pass through my body with 36 damage. The attack was heavy and left a deep mark.

17. I stood up quickly, trying to change direction and run, but Vocal blocked me before I could take another step. It wasn't about to let me get away. The feeling of defeat was approaching, and I realized that my journey might be coming to an end. All due to miscalculation and greed—the time lost facing the Elusive Rocker had started this mess. Vocal attacked again, its sharp claws hitting me, dealing another 36 damage.

18. I fell to the ground, weakened and with blurred vision. When I managed to get up, I was already exhausted, barely able to keep my sword up. As I looked ahead, I saw the monster casting a skill. It was too late. I tried to run, but the attack hit me squarely, its claws ripped off my shield and dealt me ​​77 damage. Now there was only 6 HP left. My body was finished, and my mind was consumed by the certainty of the end.

19. With no more strength to react, I knelt down and accepted the inevitable. It wasn't worth wasting my last breaths thinking about what I did wrong today. I just waited for the coup de grace that would end my journey. However, before the blow came, a bright light cut through the air, hitting the Vocal with a blast of power. A voice echoed through the jungle, strong and authoritative: "Fire Spears!" (existe essa skill mesmo? qual o nome dela em portugues? que classe?) Several red-hot spears rained down on the monster, drawing its attention away from me. The Vocal roared in pain and fury, turning to attack the wizard who had cast the spell.

20. As the monster prepared to charge at the wizard, a swordsman suddenly appeared, blocking Vocal's advance with a large, sturdy shield. The impact was so strong that the monster recoiled. I felt a light touch on my shoulder and, when I turned my face, I saw a young woman with black hair beside me. She was very beautiful and had a look full of concern. "Are you okay?" She said softly. "Rest assured, I will heal you."
