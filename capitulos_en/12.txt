After eliminating ten Savage Babes, I chose to ignore most of the Rockers around me. However, upon spotting an Elusive Rocker, the opportunity presented itself and I couldn't let it slip away. Even though the search for the monster took time, as there would be only three in this zone at a time, I thought the risk was worth it, as this enemy promised a good amount of experience and I had already just leveled up to level 15.

The Elusive Rocker stood out compared to the other monsters, with a fierce look and a defiant posture. Despite it being stronger than Rockers, I was confident I could beat it. With a quick movement, I prepared my sword and advanced, delivering the first attack. The impact made the monster thrash for an instant, and the battle began.

I advanced again with a clear blow, cutting the air with my sword and hitting the monster's body. He reacted with a roar of rage, and then lunged forward, his sharp claws seeking a vulnerable spot. I felt the pressure build as the Elusive Rocker attacked me, its claws tearing through my armor and causing considerable damage. The power of its attack made me hesitate for a moment, but I maintained my focus. I knew I couldn't waver; I just needed to keep fighting.

Every blow I landed seemed to drain his energy . However, with each of its blows, a wave of pain coursed through my body. Its very sharp claws scraped the skin in some places, making me feel the burn of battle. Blocking its attacks with my shield wouldn't always negate all of the damage. I focused on staying calm through the pain and on keeping the fight under control. I knew my opponent was getting worn out, and that certainty drove me to keep attacking.

Finally, after one last precise strike, the Elusive Rocker fell, its eyes losing their glow as its body disintegrated into motes of light. I felt neither relief nor euphoria; just the satisfaction of another battle won. The battle wounds burned, but the pain was a reminder that I was alive. As the experience I so sought accumulated, I prepared to continue, absorbing everything I had learned in that fight.

It was the first tough fight I had, and an alert went up in my head. The monster managed to inflict 196 damage on me and damaged my armor a little. Although the Formal Suit was cheap and offered good defense stats, its durability left something to be desired. I could refine it, but I didn't intend to waste time improving a useless beginner's equipment; I needed to find more valuable items for my journey.

With the victory over the Elusive Rocker, I gained 870 experience, bringing my total to 1401. Now, I was 1650 points short of reaching level However, I still only had 139 HP left, and the idea of ​​facing the Rocker, With its 155 HP, it made me afraid. He could still cause damage that could further reduce my health. Therefore, I decided to spend the rest of the day killing Savage Babes, planning to change my strategy for monster hunting the next day.

After eliminating 15 more Savage Babes, totaling 25 for the day, I reached level 16, regaining all my health, and was about to leave zone 5 of the Prontera Plains when another Elusive Rocker appeared again. I couldn't miss this opportunity to fight it.

It was getting pretty late, but I felt I still had enough time to defeat it before it gets dark. I started the battle with a strong attack, and it went a bit better than the last one, with the monster attacking mercilessly, but once again I managed to stand my ground, using my high defense to my advantage and attacking when there was an opening.

I decided I was done for the day after that fight, and started going back to the camp. Suddenly, as I approached the edge of the zone, I came face to face with a Vocal. As soon as it saw me, it started chasing me frantically. I was forced to change directions and started running in the opposite direction. 'Not a good time to stumble upon a Vocal...' I thought, frustrated, as I accelerated.

Even with a few wounds and still tired, I managed to lose it after a while. However, it was already late, and returning the same way was not an option - it could be lurking at any point. So I decided to take a longer, safer route.

Night had already fallen, and all the light I had came from the crescent moon in the sky, and it wasn't very helpful; I had to advance cautiously. 

I tore through the darkness, my breath ragged and my heart hammering in my chest. The sting of open wounds slowed me, but fear kept me moving. Every rustling leaf, every snapping branch felt like a warning. And then it happened - my worst fear came to life = A bone-chilling roar shattered the silence, cutting through the night like a blade: another Vocal.

My blood ran cold as its glowing eyes locked onto mine. For one frozen heartbeat, the world stopped. Instinct roared louder than thought, and I bolted, adrenaline surging through my veins, knowing that if I faltered for even a second, I was dead.

The monster barreled after me, its thunderous footsteps pounding the ground as its guttural snarls filled the night. Its sheer presence weighed on me like a predator's shadow, relentless and suffocating. I pushed my legs to the limit, every muscle screaming in protest, but the darkness worked against me, turning every step into a gamble. The low visibility made it impossible to shake the Vocal - I was running blind, and panic gnawed at my mind with every passing second.

Then, out of nowhere, the ground ended. A jagged cliff rose before me, its face towering and sheer, far too steep to climb. My heart sank. I was trapped.

For a fleeting moment, my hand hovered over the Fly Wings in desperation. But I hesitated. This Warp was big, and Fly Wings were unpredictable - one wrong teleport, and I could land somewhere far worse. Somewhere I wouldn't even recognize, with no idea which way to run. It was too dangerous.

The monster's growls drew closer, the vibrations of its pursuit now rattling in my bones. I clenched my fists, forcing air into my lungs despite the panic tightening my chest. There was no escape now. I had to face it, and if there was the slightest opening, I'd take it and run away. It was my only chance.

I knew full well that fighting the Vocal was suicide. But I didn’t need to win, I just needed a way out. Tightening my grip on my sword, I raised my shield, bracing myself to block the first strike and hoping for a miracle, a split-second opening to escape. My pulse pounded in my ears as the beast charged, the ground trembling beneath its weight.

It lunged with terrifying force, and I barely got my shield up in time. The impact was like being hit by a runaway boulder. The force slammed into me, ripping the breath from my lungs as the shield absorbed the brunt of the attack. I was sent flying backward, crashing hard onto the rocky ground. A sharp, burning jolt shot through my ribs.

Pain clouded my mind, but I couldn’t stop. The Vocal roared, already closing the distance again, relentless and hungry. I scrambled to my feet, desperation fueling my movements, and tried to pivot away, hoping to outrun fate. But the Vocal was faster, too fast. It lunged, cutting off my path with terrifying speed. Panic clawed at my chest as the crushing weight of failure began to settle over me.

With a feral snarl, the monster lashed out again. Its claws tore through the air and raked across my side, hitting the shield, sending a searing wave of pain through my body. I hit the ground hard, the impact jarring my bones. My vision blurred, colors and shadows blending together as exhaustion wrapped around me like chains.

I forced myself up, trembling with every movement. My sword felt heavier than ever, my muscles barely able to lift it. I could only watch in horror as the Vocal began channeling a skill. I knew what was coming. My instincts screamed at me to move, but my body was too slow. The claws hit their mark, shredding my shield like paper and sinking into my flesh. Agony exploded through me and the world around me spun. My HP was down to 36. One more hit, and even if I blocked it again, I’d be finished.

I dropped to my knees, panting and beaten, every ounce of strength drained from my limbs. There was nothing left to do but gamble. With shaking hands, I reached for the Fly Wing, my last hope. But just as I was about to activate it, the night was pierced by a sudden flash of light.

A searing beam of magic slammed into the Vocal, forcing it back with sheer force. The air crackled with energy as a powerful voice rang out, cutting through the darkness with commanding authority.

"Firebolt!"

Blazing spears of fire streaked through the sky, each one slamming into the monster with precision. The Vocal howled in rage, the flames scorching its thick hide. Its fury turned from me to the new threat, and with an ear-splitting roar, it pivoted to face the caster.

My heart pounded as I glanced toward the source of the spell. A wizard stood at the edge of the clearing, robes fluttering in the wind, staff glowing with raw power. He had saved me, just in time.

As the monster prepared to charge at the Wizard, a Swordsman suddenly appeared, blocking Vocal's advance with a large, sturdy shield. The impact was so strong that the monster recoiled. I felt a light touch on my shoulder and, when I turned my face, I saw a beautiful young woman with black hair beside me. She had a look full of concern. "Are you okay?" She said softly. "Rest assured, I will heal you. You are safe now."
