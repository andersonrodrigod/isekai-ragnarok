1. After eliminating ten Savage Babes, I chose to ignore most of the Rockers around me. However, upon spotting an Elusive Rocker, the opportunity presented itself and I couldn't let it slip away. Even though the search for the monster took time, as there were only three in the region and they only reappeared after being defeated, I knew that the risk was worth it, as this enemy promised a good amount of experience and I had already just leveled up to level 15.

2. The Elusive Rocker stood out among the rest, with a fierce look and a defiant posture. I knew that, despite being a little stronger than the average Rockers, it was nothing I couldn't face. With a quick movement, I prepared my sword and advanced, delivering the first attack. The impact made the monster twitch, and the battle began intensely.

3. The fight began when I advanced with a clear blow, cutting the air with my sword and hitting the monster's body. He reacted with a roar of rage, and then lunged forward, his sharp claws seeking a vulnerable spot. I felt the pressure build as the Elusive Rocker attacked me, its claws tearing through my armor and causing considerable damage. The impact of his strength made me hesitate for a moment, but I maintained my concentration. I knew I couldn't waver; each successful attack brought me closer to victory.

4. The monster moved quickly, trying to surround me, while I tried to dodge its attacks. Every blow I landed seemed to cut not only at his energy, but also at his resolve. However, with each attack he made, I felt pain penetrate my body. Its very sharp claws scraped the skin in some places, making me feel the burn of battle. But I knew it was just part of the game; a price he was willing to pay. I focused on staying calm and controlling the situation. I knew he was getting worn out, and that certainty drove me to keep attacking.

5. Every blow I struck seemed to cut not only at his energy but also at his resolve. However, with each attack he made, pain penetrated my body. Its very sharp claws scraped the skin in some places, making me feel the burn of battle. With each impact, the shield vibrated, and even though it had reduced some of the damage, there was still a cost. I knew it was just part of the game; a price he was willing to pay. I focused on staying calm and controlling the situation. I knew he was getting worn out, and that certainty drove me to keep attacking.

6. Finally, after one last precise strike, the Elusive Rocker fell, his eyes losing their glow as his body disintegrated into motes of light. I felt neither relief nor euphoria; just the satisfaction of another battle won. The battle wounds burned, but the pain was a reminder that I was alive and fighting. As the experience I so sought accumulated, I prepared to continue, absorbing everything I had learned in that fight.

7. It was the first tough fight I had, and an alert went up in my head. The monster managed to inflict 196 damage on me and damaged my armor a little. Although the Formal Suit was cheap and offered good defense stats, its durability left something to be desired. Maybe if I refined it, it would improve a little, but I didn't intend to waste time improving a useless beginner's equipment; I needed to find more valuable items for my journey.

8. With the victory over the Elusive Rocker, I gained 870 experience, bringing my total to 1401. Now, I was 1650 points short of reaching level 16. However, I still only had 139 HP left, and the idea of ​​facing the Rocker, With its 155 HP, it made me afraid. He could still cause damage that could further reduce my health. Therefore, I decided to spend the rest of the day killing Savage Babes, planning to change my strategy for monster hunting the next day.

9. After eliminating 15 more Savage Babes, totaling 25 for the day, I was about to leave zone 5 of the Prontera Plains when another Elusive Rocker appeared again. I couldn't miss this opportunity to fight him.

10. The monster was a challenging opponent, but the reward in experience was worth the risk. The battle started intensely, with Rocker attacking quickly and mercilessly, but I managed to stand my ground, taking advantage of my defense and attacking with precision. However, worry began to consume me; The sun was already setting, and the sky was quickly darkening. I was alone in that forest, and the thought of getting lost without a torch made me uneasy. Finally, when I managed to take down the Elusive Rocker, a sense of urgency came over me.

11. With my heart racing and my injuries still fresh, I began to run towards the camp, but darkness enveloped everything before I could reach it, plunging me into an oppressive darkness filled with unknown dangers.

12. I kept running, but the darkness was relentless. The only thing that lit my path was the moon, faint and distant, revealing only a small part of the trail in front of me. Without seeing enough, I decided to stop and try to look around, but everything seemed inhospitable and desolate.

13. No lights, no indication of where I was. The worst-case scenario was confirmed: I was lost, surrounded by a jungle full of dangerous monsters. The last time I located myself, I was about to leave zone 5, but now I didn't know if I was still there or if I had, by accident, crossed into another zone, where the monsters were more aggressive, mercilessly attacking anyone who dared to pass by. .

14. I stood still, trying to listen for anything that would help me orient myself, until my biggest fear in that area came true. The piercing sound of a roar echoed in the forest: a Vocal. When our eyes met, there was no escape.

15. monster came towards me without hesitation, its presence overwhelming. I ran as hard as I could, but it seemed impossible to outrun him. Each step took me deeper into unknown territory, not knowing if I was running into even more dangerous zones or moving in circles. Desperate, I bumped into a high hill that blocked my path, making any attempt to climb impossible. I was cornered. There was no other choice but to fight.

16. I knew my chances against Vocal were almost non-existent, but I couldn't give up without trying. I drew my sword and held my shield tightly, preparing to repel the first attack and perhaps find an opening to flee. The monster advanced with force, the impact of its blow threw me back violently. I felt the blow pass through my body with 36 damage. The attack was heavy and left a deep mark.

17. I stood up quickly, trying to change direction and run, but Vocal blocked me before I could take another step. He wasn't about to let me get away. The feeling of defeat was approaching, and I realized that my journey might be coming to an end. All due to miscalculation and greed—the time lost facing the Elusive Rocker had slowed me down. Vocal attacked again, its sharp claws hitting me, dealing another 36 damage.

18. I fell to the ground, weakened and with blurred vision. When I managed to get up, I was already exhausted, barely able to keep my sword up. As I looked ahead, I saw the monster casting a skill. It was too late. I tried to run, but the attack hit me squarely, its claws ripped off my shield and dealt me ​​77 damage. Now there was only 6 HP left. My body was finished, and my mind was consumed by the certainty of the end.

19. With no more strength to react, I knelt down and accepted the inevitable. I waited for the coup de grace that would end my journey. However, before the blow came, a bright light cut through the air, hitting Vocal with a blast of power. A voice echoed through the jungle, strong and authoritative: "Fire Spears!" Several red-hot spears rained down on the monster, drawing its attention away from me. The Vocal roared in pain and fury, turning to attack the wizard who had cast the spell.

20. As the monster prepared to charge at the wizard, a swordsman suddenly appeared, blocking Vocal's advance with a large, sturdy shield. The impact was so strong that the monster recoiled. I felt a light touch on my shoulder and, when I turned my face, I saw a young woman with black hair and an attractive appearance beside me. She had a calm look, but full of concern. "Are you well?" – His voice was soft, but full of confidence. "Rest assured, I will heal you."
