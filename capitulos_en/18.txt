We woke up at dawn, the first rays of sunlight painting the camp in a soft, golden light. All around, the muffled sound of footsteps and murmurs of other adventurers also preparing for the day ahead. The morning air was cool and damp, filled with the smell of campfires that were already beginning to be extinguished by the morning wind.

After preparing, we headed towards Zone 11. I configured my Status Plate to receive and share all the information about the monsters in the area with Drakon, taking the moment to explain to the group what awaited us. The zone was mainly inhabited by aggressive monsters, and there was one in particular that deserved our attention: the Elusive Goblin. With his high vitality and brutal attack, he could pose a threat. 

"Luckily," I continued, "the Elusive Goblins are territorial and rarely appear in pairs, unlike the Swift Elder Willows, which we faced in Zone 10. The challenge here is that all the monsters will attack us on sight." This made the group visibly tense, but I warned that we could stay on the border of the zone. "If things get out of hand, we just retreat. Monsters rarely go beyond the boundaries of their own area."

As we walked, we came across several adventurers. Their numbers seemed to increase every day, which also brought about another interesting phenomenon: the more frequent appearance of monsters. In the past, it was necessary to look for distant points to find them isolated, but now, they appeared close to us. I think of the Labyrinth of Minos, where all the monsters are aggressive. If we ever head there, known in-game as PRT_MAZE, we'll need a well-equipped party and several potions. Getting lost in that maze would be the end.

After some time of walking, we saw the entrance marker to Zone 11 in the Prontera Plains. “Well, everyone, from this sign we are officially in Zone 11,” I announced to the group, taking in the scenery. "You can see that there are other adventurers around here, and as expected, there are many monsters too. We don't need to compete; we just hunt the available monsters and, if they reach our limits, we leave and recover."

The challenge of leading a small group is that it prevents me from developing ideal strategies. With a group of at least 15 people, I could rehearse combat tactics, prepare combos and formations that ensured greater safety and efficiency. This preparation could be decisive in a strategic fight, especially against other groups or if an unexpected confrontation with mercenaries, bandits or assassins occurred.

We entered Zone 11, where I saw several adventurers busy on their missions. Among them, I noticed a bard — one of the archer class evolutions. He was walking with a group of four people, all from lower classes than him. I frowned watching, he should already be around level 40, so his presence here was intriguing; this zone was relatively weak for someone of his level. Perhaps he was looking for something other than simple experience.

While analyzing the situation, a goblin armed with an ax suddenly appeared and charged straight towards Kaelyn. Realizing the imminent attack, I positioned my shield in front of her in time to block the blow, counterattacking with my sword. The goblin managed to block it with his own shield, but the impact still caused slight damage to his arm. I immediately shouted, "Noctis, now!"

Noctis acted quickly, attacking the goblin from the side and applying poison, while Drakon finished with a Sonic Blow blow, which broke the monster's shield and threw it away. Suddenly, the goblin, instead of continuing the fight, turned to flee. I looked in disbelief, which surprised me. In the game, monsters never ran away; they kept attacking until they were defeated. The situation awakened a new concern in me: 'what if we faced a mini-boss and he tried to escape when he realized he was going to lose?' This could get quite complicated.

As I prepared to chase the goblin, a conjuration from Elarius, Spears of Fire, hit him, ending the fight and distributing the experience between us. That made me think about the need to adjust our positioning in future battles to avoid surprises.

After this incident, I observed other monsters in combat with groups of adventurers nearby. There were at least four other groups around us, each with at least four people. I noticed something strange: some monsters tried to escape and, in some situations, joined forces with other goblins to attack the adventurers. Reflecting on this, I asked the group: “Have you ever seen monsters running away or joining others to attack?”

Kaelyn cast an uncertain look at Noctis, who, scratching his head, hesitantly muttered, “I never noticed that, but… now that you mention it…” Drakon also looked disconcerted, frowning and crossing his arms as he replied, “This is the first time I've seen this. I’ve never heard anyone talk about monsters running away, but… come to think of it, I guess it’s not that far-fetched.”

Elarius, however, looked at me with an attentive and suspicious expression, slightly arching an eyebrow. In a cautious tone, he commented: “I share your doubt, Azoth, but... considering that you are not exactly from this world, you should find it more evident, or at least, less strange, don't you think?”

I swallowed hard, I felt my heart speed up and I contained my nervousness. Elarius was more attentive to what was happening around him than I imagined, it seemed like he was already beginning to suspect something. I looked in his direction quickly and replied: “I thought it was strange because, before Zone 10, I never witnessed a situation where monsters ran away from their enemies. I’ve defeated hundreds of them, and none of them ever backed down.”

Elarius kept his gaze fixed on me for a moment before nodding slightly, still with a suspicious expression. “I see,” he replied, crossing his arms and looking at the horizon with a frown, thoughtfully. “This is also the first time I have seen this. And as far as I know, the books never mentioned anything about monsters teaming up or running away. I have always read that they are irrational creatures, that they defend their territories or attack intruders without hesitation.”

When we least expected it, a goblin appeared in front of us, advancing in a threatening manner. “In position!” I ordered firmly, and soon noticed two other goblins approaching diagonally, about 100 meters away. “We have no time to waste, attack, Drakon!” The words came out quickly, running over each other, as adrenaline took over me.

Drakon charged at the goblin with his Sonic Blow ability, destroying the creature's improvised shield and leaving it vulnerable. I took advantage of the opening and struck his chest, hitting him squarely. The goblin, although visibly weakened, tried to counterattack me, but its slowness allowed me to dodge. At that moment, Elarius cast Napalm Beat, dealing devastating damage. Upon realizing that his death was inevitable, the goblin began to crawl, trying to escape. Kaelyn, agile, delivered the final blow with her dagger, stabbing it into his head.

After the combat ended, I watched the goblins approaching in the distance. I looked to the side, but I didn't see any other immediate threat. However, when I turned my gaze towards Kaelyn, I saw a goblin with an ax in hand, about to attack her. Without thinking twice, I ran towards her and shouted, “Kaelyn, behind you! Careful!" She heard me in time, backing towards me as the goblin jumped to attack her. I raised my shield, blocking the blow and protecting our novice.

But my concern for Kaelyn left me exposed, and another goblin took the opportunity, attacking me from the side. I tried to defend myself by throwing the shield towards him, but the blow was accurate, and I was thrown a short distance away, suffering considerable damage. The creature had taken 112 points off my life, and before I could even ask for healing, Kaelyn was already casting a recovery spell. After healing me, she muttered, "Thanks for letting me know... I was a little refreshed after defeating that goblin."

“Stay focused,” I replied firmly. “Here, any mistakes will be punished by the monsters.” We continue on the same page against the two remaining goblins. Although they were not difficult to defeat individually, the way they appeared and attacked in groups required maximum attention. In previous zones, it was easier to relax as we knew the number of aggressive monsters was limited. Now, however, the difficulty seemed to have increased, forcing the group to train their perceptions and pay attention to each movement. We defeated both goblins, but before I could suggest taking a break to discuss our strategy, two new monsters appeared.

One of them was a Goblin Archer, who immediately shot an arrow towards us. I managed to intercept the arrow with my shield, but in the meantime, the second monster, a Rotar Zairo, was hurtling through the air toward us, its blades spinning like those of a helicopter. “Noctis, Drakon, deal with the Goblin Archer! Let’s save time here!” I ordered quickly.

Drakon and Noctis dashed off to catch up with the Goblin Archer, who was keeping a safe distance, while I turned to Elarius and asked, “What skills do you have?”

He promptly replied: “Stone Curse, Cold Bolt, Lightning Bolt, Napalm Beat and Fire Bolt.”

I was pleased to hear that he had learned skills from different elements. This would be essential for dealing with varied enemies. “Elarius, cast Stone Curse on Rotar Zairo,” I ordered.

He hesitated, looking at me skeptically, but warned, “This skill does no damage. It might be a waste of MP.”

I just nodded. “Trust me, just do it.”

He cast the spell, petrifying Rotar Zairo and disrupting its propellers, which caused the monster to fall to the ground. Taking advantage of his vulnerability, I advanced and struck him directly, breaking through his defense. Kaelyn followed up with a dagger attack, but our damage was still limited without Drakon, our main source of damage.

When Rotar Zairo returned to normal, he hesitated, seemingly recovering before floating back. Sensing the opportunity, I ordered again: “Elarius, cast Stone Curse again!”

He complied, and once again petrified the monster, while muttering, "If we keep this up, my MP will run out, and we're not doing much damage."

Before the monster could recover, Drakon and Noctis returned after defeating the Goblin Archer. With perfect synchronization, both attacked Rotar Zairo from behind, flanking him and dealing decisive damage. The monster fell defeated with the last blow, and a feeling of relief ran through the group.
