1. I arrived at Einbroch late in the afternoon, satisfied with the gains from my last productive days collecting items to accumulate Zenys. I confess that, in the game, hunting monsters and collecting the items they dropped was much more fun. Now, immersed in this world, I have to go out every day to get some items. Maybe joining an expedition will make things more interesting.

2. Upon arriving at the inn, my frustration began. Tayla reminded me that today was my last paid day and that I would need to renew my hosting if I wanted to continue. I had exactly 1,345 Zenys, so I decided to pay for another 6 days, leaving me with only 145 Zenys. Tomorrow, I would have to go to the market and try to get more money.

3. ...

4. The next morning, I woke up determined to put all my remaining skill points into the Overbilling skill. Now, with a 5 point increase in skill, I could sell my items for an additional 15% profit.

5. Before leaving, I took a look at the merchant options on my status board and reviewed the items in my inventory to decide where to sell them. Unlike the game, there are no NPCs to sell here. You trade directly with people or other merchants. Only merchants have access to sales and purchases via the status board, and while I don't fully understand how this works, it would be much better if it was an option available to all classes. It seems like another way to monopolize trade and leave other classes out.

6. The truth is that the merchant class has always been one of the least chosen. Blacksmiths and alchemists are not very popular in expeditions, as they are more strategic classes. Perhaps these exclusive roles for merchants are an attempt to encourage more people to follow this path.

7. After seeing that most of my items had buyers at the Einbroch market, I left the inn and headed towards the market. After a few minutes of walking, I saw the market. It was located on a suburban street in Einbroch, a place dominated by industrial buildings and heavy machinery. The air had a faint smell of oil and burnt metal, typical of the industry. Stalls were lined up along the street, mixing elements of traditional commerce with steampunk high technology. They were metal and glass structures, some covered in neon signs that flashed with advertisements for items and prices.

8. I opened my status board and looked for the numbers of the stalls that were purchasing my items. The closest one was number 7. I approached the totem, where there were two options: buy or sell. I selected sell, and the first valuable item in my inventory appeared: a Rainbow Carrot. This item is extremely rare, with a drop rate of just 1%. I had gotten this item together with Rox, and later, exploring alone. This carrot alone was worth 1,250 Zenys.

9. After visiting the other stalls and selling almost all of my inventory, I made a good amount of money. I was relieved, because after today, it wouldn't go back into the triple digits. Now, finally, I could explore a little more of this world without worrying so much about housing costs.

10. It was already the fourth day since Rox went to make her class transition. It seemed like the other classes required more than just a simple ritual like tossing a coin.

11. There are still three days until he returns. Ideally, I would continue leveling up, but I need to venture into a slightly denser area of ​​the jungle in the Plains of Prontera. I'll have to face slightly stronger monsters. Now that I've managed to save a reasonable amount of money, I can better prepare myself to fight them alone, without wasting time.

12. I remember that, in the Plains of Prontera, you can go far and find more suitable monsters in the slightly denser jungle. I need to prepare beforehand. First, I'll go to the Smoke Sentinels Adventurer's Guild to find out what monsters I can face alone, and then buy some effective equipment for that place.

13. "Look who's here! He's become a merchant! Very unusual for someone who likes exploring so much. Tell me, what's your plan? Because merchants are usually workhorses on expeditions," she said, winking. fun.

14. What she said was inevitable, but I had a plan for after Rox got back. With his help, I would definitely be able to achieve my goal.

15. "Well, it's not that I want to reveal my plan to you," I replied, putting on a superior pose, trying to hide my smile. "But I foresee exponential growth for myself. An inflection point, and from there, it will be difficult to catch up."

16. "I hope it doesn't take so long," she said, with a smile that reminded her of an anxious aunt waiting for good news. "But so, what do you order?"

17. "I came to get information about monsters from a certain area of ​​the Prontera Plains," I replied, pointing to my status board.

18. "You know that this information is not free, right? You only have free access if there is a quest and the person responsible for the quest provides the monster's information to facilitate the completion of the quest," Rose said, gesturing expressively, as if was explaining something obvious.

19. Although I found her last line strange, it was really true. I had only found information about the monsters I had to hunt, and in Viperspire, some of the quests I took didn't have information about certain monsters. For example, I had no data on the Alpha Lunatic, and the doubt persisted in my mind.

20. “Who gets to collect this information?” I asked, with a touch of curiosity.

21. "All information about monsters is collected by people in the Professor class. They gather this data and sell it to the guilds. Many teachers make good money just by selling the monster status information and the items they drop," explained Rose , with a look of admiration for the profession.

22. You'd expect someone to do that. In the game, we had access to a database, but here, in reality, information needs to be collected and stored. The Professor class really seemed suitable for this task.

23. "Okay, so what's the value of information about the monsters of the Prontera Plains?" I asked, with an expectant expression.

24. "The information we have from the Plains is the cheapest, as it is in a busy location. It only costs 500 Zenys," she replied, with an almost triumphant tone of voice.

25. 'It's getting more and more complicated,' I thought, feeling the pressure building. It seems like every time I evolve and level up, I need more things, and everything becomes more expensive. But it was necessary information, so I paid and received on my status board all the information about the monsters in the Prontera Plains jungle area.

26. Looking at the information on my status board, I saw that there was a promising location in the Prontera Plains called PRT_FILD08. The monsters there had statuses that indicated they were possible to defeat, and I could gain a good amount of experience without spending a lot of resources on potions. It was the ideal scenario, so I decided to prepare.

27. I opened my status board again and started checking for good, affordable equipment that would allow me to spend as much time as possible in that location. After reviewing everything, I wasted no time and went straight to the market once again. Today would be shopping day.
