The energy of victory coursed through each of us as we prepared for the last confrontation with the remaining Swift Elder Willow. Now, renewed and stronger, fear had given way to confidence, and a determined gleam appeared in the group's eyes. This last monster would be the key to consolidating our strength.

With renewed momentum, I charged towards the monster, focusing all my speed for a direct attack. The blade found the creature's flesh, a deep cut that made it recoil. I kept my shield up, feeling the strength of the monster trying to destabilize me, but I resisted, firm.

Drakon, now more confident with his level increase, smiled before summoning his Magnum Break skill once more. He charged forward, sword in hand, delivering the devastating blow. This time, without the golden aura from the previous critical attack, the impact was not as explosive, but it still took 640 health points from the monster. The Swift Elder Willow twitched, but Drakon stared at him, standing firm and prepared for more.

Noctis appeared soon after, a swift shadow with his sharp blade. In one fluid movement, he cut through the monster and disappeared like a puff of pure skill. The creature barely had time to react before he was back at my side. Kaelyn, attentive, cast a heal on me to keep my energy steady while I maintained the creature's aggro.

We continued like this, alternating blows and skills with precision, maintaining control and the rhythm of the battle. Our movements were in sync and mutual trust guided us. With my last attack, I saw the Swift Elder Willow collapse. Finally, the dust settled.

As the last echo of the battle faded, silent relief washed over everyone. A weight seemed to be lifted from our shoulders, and we felt victory. A small smile spread across each face as we checked out our new strength: Noctis, Kaelyn, and I had now leveled up to level 18, and Elarius had leveled up to level 19. Tired but with a renewed sense of achievement, we knew this was just the beginning of something grand.

The sun began to sink below the horizon, dyeing the sky with shades of orange and gold, as we decided to return to camp. We felt the weight of the day on our legs, but at the same time, there was a certain pride and excitement in the air. Today's battle was memorable, and among the scars of the fight, I had discovered the true potential of my Mammonite ability. Although the damage I dealt was lower than that of the fighters in the group, this ability proved surprisingly valuable to me — after all, my class is not a direct combat class. At its maximum potential, Mammonite can increase my attack by up to 600%. For someone who wants to become an alchemist and creator, it is a precious asset that will be of great use in future journeys.

As we walked back, I couldn't help but think about the intense aura that surrounded Drakon during the battle. Finally, I couldn't contain my curiosity and asked:
"That aura... What was that?"

Before Drakon could respond, Noctis stepped forward, with a didactic and confident tone:
"That was the culmination of an attack, the so-called Critical Hit. It's a feat that few can perform frequently, and it's a specialty for classes like Thieves, Hunters and their evolutions. We constantly train to perfect this attribute.", he said with the expression of someone who explained something with knowledge of the facts.

I thought about what he said. The LUK (luck) attribute seemed essential for these critical attacks, and although it was not common for someone of my class to invest in this attribute, perhaps it could be useful to me in the future when I sought to become an alchemist, increasing my accuracy in creating potions.

But soon a less glorious thought occurred to me. Using Mammonite had a bitter cost: each strike consumed 300 Zenys. When carrying out three attacks, I saw 900 Zenys of my assets disappear into thin air. I walked in silence, still calculating my expenses, when Drakon approached me with a smile and an unexpected compliment.

"Hey man, you fought really well today. In a moment of extreme tension, you remained calm and coordinated our strategies masterfully. Where did you learn those support skills??" Drakon seemed genuinely curious, his eyes alert, awaiting my response.

I knew I couldn't tell the truth — that in my old Ragnarok game world, I led the most powerful guild in the game, with legendary status in the Emperium Wars, where everyone respected me as an invincible leader. Instead, I made an excuse that sounded silly even to me: "In my world, I ran a small business. I needed to manage people, resolve conflicts, and distribute tasks. I think that experience helps me guide them now.", I I said this trying to sound convincing, but internally hoping he wouldn't notice my hesitation.

Taking advantage of that moment of calm, I looked at Drakon and said, "I've been thinking... It would be good if I took on the role of strategic support in the group. As I showed in the last battle, I can stay calm and think clearly, even in the most difficult situations." tense. With this, I can guide our group in great battles, leading everyone to memorable victories. I guarantee that I will guide you in the best way, like a true strategist, without sacrificing anyone."

Drakon backed away a little, which was to be expected. He was always considered the natural leader of the group, and his prominent position seemed fundamental to him. Perhaps it would not be easy to accept the idea of ​​sharing this responsibility, let alone the possibility of making room for another leadership figure. Noticing his reaction, I persisted, adopting a conciliatory tone. "No need to worry, I know you fear that I might 'steal' your position. But to me, you will always be a great leader and, more than that, a true brother to all of us. Your integrity and sense of justice These are rare qualities, and I admire that. But in a battle, we need someone capable of making strategic decisions without being influenced by the chaos around them... perhaps it's not your strong suit."

Drakon looked like he was about to interrupt me, but I continued, seizing the opportunity, "As a swordsman, you are always on the front lines, fighting with instinct and courage. But in certain battles, we need someone who looks at the bigger picture and makes decisions with a vision." broader. This is the role I want to perfect myself in. Strategic support can complement your talent."

The entire group nodded, understanding the need for what I proposed. Some even murmured in agreement, recognizing that Drakon was, indeed, a more impulsive figure. He looked at me with a serious face, and for a moment it seemed as if my words had really touched him. Then he turned his back, clearly processing everything, and then looked at me again, saying, "Okay... let's see how this goes." He accepted, although I knew it was partly due to peer pressure.

I smiled internally. That was the first step. Soon, Drakon would understand the importance of this new arrangement and, later on, he would end up thanking me. The challenge now was to gain their complete trust, especially considering that my starting class is absolute rubbish in combat. The merchant class has its advantages, but the beginning is relentless — it's practically impossible to fight alone, resources are scarce, and without support, I found myself vulnerable at every step.

If I could go back in time, I would have joined a group from the beginning, instead of letting myself be carried away by the arrogance of thinking I was superior to everyone. In this new world, I realize that diplomacy is essential much more than in the previous world, and the idea of ​​being a solo adventurer now seems completely foolish to me.

-----

Almost arriving at camp, I decided to check my inventory to see what items I had obtained since the beginning of the expedition. It was undeniable that I had gained a lot of experience and, now that I had the support of this group, I saw even greater potential for our future adventures. With a well-coordinated strategy, we could face stronger monsters, with chances of obtaining rare and higher-value items.

Among the items, I found another Fire Bolt skill scroll. As I had thought before, when I became an alchemist, the class's common skills were mostly for a more defensive and control strategy. These scrolls could be useful if I needed an offensive alternative, but it's been a while since I seriously considered them. It might be interesting to find out where to get more of these scrolls; they could be a key piece to ambush certain enemies.

However, the most impressive item I found was the Elder Willow Card. Since I arrived in this world, I had not yet come across letters. I only knew, from the game, that they could be equipped on items to grant additional attributes or even active or passive effects. With this question in mind, I turned to my companions and asked: "Hey, I have a question. If I have a card and I want to equip it on some equipment, how should I do it?"

Elarius immediately gave me an excited look, almost impatient to respond, like someone who finally has the chance to talk about their favorite topic. "Ah, if you want to know about letters, you've come to talk to the right person!" —he replied, with a sparkle of enthusiasm and a hint of greed in his eyes. It was clear that, for him, the world of cards was a territory of possibilities and gains.
