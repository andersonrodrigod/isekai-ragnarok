"Well, you're free to go out and explore on your own, face monsters, and survive however you see fit," said Mary, with a slight smile. However, her tone soon became more serious. "But there are some things you need to understand. Although there are no restrictions for those who wish to roam the plains on their own, participating in the quests organized by the guild is a little different. To get access to our quests without official membership, you'll need to register as a guest in the guild. With a fee of 300 Zenys per person, you will have access to all available quests, in addition to the support of our network of information and benefits that can facilitate your survival and progress here."

Mary paused before continuing, as if considering the next important point to mention. "Oh, and something that might interest you... have you ever heard of Linker Rings?"

I shook my head, curious.

"These are special rings that allow you to form groups of adventurers and divide combat experience among all members of the group. When you are in a group with these rings, the experience you and your allies gain by defeating monsters is shared just like items, which can greatly accelerate your growth and make it fair to divide items. However, they have a limited lifespan. I have these that are expiring in two days, you can buy them for 200 Zenys."

As I pondered Mary's words, it became apparent that Viperspire was more than just a guild. They seemed to be actively exploring all avenues for profit, constantly seeking new ways to generate income. 

I asked Rox for a loan of 150 Zeny, necessary so I could sign up and access Viperspire's quest advantages. He gladly accepted, understanding the importance of this opportunity for our progress as adventurers.

After registering, I was able to access the available quests. I went to the large digital board, where several quests were listed. Many of them involved Fly Wings, an item that, despite being expensive on the market, was easy to obtain and served as a quick random teleportation between locations. I decided to avoid these quests so that I could save the Fly Wings that I will get during our adventures.

It was then that I saw a very useful mission: 10 Feathers, 12 Carrots, 5 Fluff, 6 Jellopy, 2 Green Herbs, 4 Apples. The reward for this quest was 700 Zenys, which meant I could split 350 for myself and 350 to Rox. However, considering all the expenses, from teleportation to completing the mission, I realized that we would not be able to surpass the value of 450 Zenys.

In light of this, I had the idea of ​​asking Rox if he would like to spend two days exploring the plains of Prontera. I believe that this way we would be able to not only cover our costs, but also advance our experience levels. Rox accepted the proposal

Before our departure, I carefully noted the monster information on the digital board. A dedicated section displayed details about local creatures and the items they dropped

Soon after we left towards the jungle on the plains of Prontera.

As we explored the jungle, the atmosphere around us became increasingly vibrant and full of life. The smell of fresh greenery filled the air, and the sound of leaves blowing in the breeze created a peaceful melody. Soon, we realized that we were not alone; other adventurers, in pairs and trios, were also on the hunt, facing the typical Porings that moved smoothly across the ground.

In that area, monsters were docile and only attacked when provoked. I saw a Poring near a tree - a small, pink jelly with a cute smile and big eyes. It was an ordinary monster, with a cute and harmless appearance.

I approached the creature. "Try to always attack it from its flanks. It takes higher damage that way." I said to Rox.

Rox nodded, preparing for action. As soon as we positioned ourselves, the surrounded Poring turned towards him. I then took the opportunity and moved forward, slashing with my knife. However, my attack was not enough to defeat him immediately. The angry Poring turned to me and attacked, dealing 7 points of damage.

"Now it's my turn!" shouted Rox, throwing himself at the Poring. With a precise strike, he managed to defeat him. The small gelatinous creature exploded in a rain of gelatin, leaving behind a few items that glittered in the sunlight.

The items were automatically added to our inventories. Before the fight, we agreed to let the Linker Ring handle item distribution. Satisfied with our first victory, we continued looking for more Porings to hunt.

We managed to defeat 15 Porings before finally getting the last apple we needed. With that, both Rox and I rose to level 7, our enthusiasm growing with each victory. With the items in hand, we then decided to go in search of the Lunatics.

The Lunatics were strange and somewhat comical creatures, with small, round bodies covered in bluish fur and bulging eyes that seemed to always be in a state of surprise. They were known for their erratic behavior, jumping and spinning unpredictably, making fighting them a true test of skill and reflexes.

We used the same battle strategy with all the monsters, and as we walked through the jungle we were lucky enough to encounter the Alpha Lunatic several times, a more robust and imposing version of the regular Lunatic. The Alpha Lunatic was not only more intimidating with darker fur and a fiercer gaze, but it also had a higher drop rate of Fly Wings, which helped increase our supply.

As we faced these creatures, our experience continued to increase, and we soon reached level 8. It was already starting to get dark when we decided we'll now be hunting the Fabre, a monster that was known to have a stronger attack, one of the more powerful monsters in this regions.

I quickened my pace alongside Rox, eager to get the items needed to complete our mission. The sun was low on the horizon, and I started to worry about not being able to finish the quest today. When we found the Fabres, we noticed they were long, slender creatures, covered in green fur and with long ears. Its eyes had a curious gleam, but one should not be deceived; They were known for their quick and relentless attack.

We fought valiantly, defeating 10 Fabres and reaching level 9. Unfortunately, my knife broke during the battle and will need repairs. Exhausted, we collapsed to the ground, our heavy breathing a testament to the day's intensity

“We did it!” said Rox, tired but with a satisfied smile on his face.

“Let's go back before it gets dark, or we'll get lost.” I replied, standing up quickly and extending my hand to help him up. With that, we started our way back to the Viperspire camp.

The camp was a bustling scene of bonfires, lanterns, and the delicious aroma of roasting meat. Laughter and conversation filled the air as adventurers returned from their expeditions. Pushing through the crowd, I headed toward the Viperspire Mansion to complete our mission

After receiving our reward, I left the mansion and noticed the diversity of people in that camp. Rox, who was relaxed, noticed my expression and asked: "What are you looking for?"

"A Blacksmith or a Merchant. I need to repair my knife." I replied, a little frustrated.

Rox looked around, his curious gaze fixed on one of the stalls and he suggested, "How about going to that store?"

"It is not very appropriate for us to go to equipment stores generally. Cheap apprentice equipment is not found there. Swords that are not valuable are either found with blacksmiths or merchants," I explained.

While we were talking, Rox spotted a blacksmith in one of the camp's tents and we went over to him.

The blacksmith, an elderly man, greeted us as we arrived and asked, "New adventurers?"

Rox happily replied, "Yeah, we're new adventurers! Just back from our first expedition together."

I removed his arm from my shoulders and asked, "Can you repair my knife?"

He took the knife in his hands, examined it carefully, and commented, "Look, it's more appropriate to buy another one. After it breaks the first time, if you don't refine it, it will break quickly. I have this one.. ."

Before he finished speaking, I interrupted: "Sir, I don't have any money. If you could fix it so it can last another day, that would be a great help." As I spoke, I gestured sincerely, hoping he understood my situation.

"Calm down, boy. I understand your situation. Don't worry, the knife I'm going to offer you is very affordable. Or are you going to tell me that there aren't 30 Zenys there?"

He seemed like an honest person. The knife I had only cost 25 Zenys, and he was only asking for 5 Zenys more. So I decided to buy the knife. It seemed like he wasn't too worried about the money. I thanked him and turned to Rox.

"Come on, Rox. Let's find a spot to sleep at the camp and save some money on lodging."

The blacksmith overheard us and generously offered, "Hey there, boys. Need a place to stay tonight? How about keeping an old man company?"
