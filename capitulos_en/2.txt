1. I woke up in the morning, stretched, took a shower, and got ready to go to the Adventurer's Guild. Today, my goal is to take on my first quest. While I get ready, I think about which quest would be ideal for me. Since I'm alone and still at level 1, it would be risky to face monsters. At my level, it could be brutal to face something I can't defeat.

2. I also need to consider the issue of death. There should be no rebirth after dying here. Although I have access to my attributes and items in a "virtual" way, everything feels very real. I feel my body whole, I can feel pain, so it's essential that I value my life above all else.

3. Just like me, other former Ragnarok players have probably also reincarnated in this world. They will use all the knowledge from the game to become stronger as quickly as possible and obtain rare items. They will be more efficient than the natives of this world, since we have had access to privileged information for most of our lives.

4. I left my room and went to talk to Kafra. I hadn't noticed before, but she was a very pretty young woman with brown hair and blue eyes. She was always smiling. "Hello, how was your stay, Azoth?" she asked, her gaze piercing and her cheeks slightly flushed. "It was a great night's sleep," I replied. "That's great! Would you like to reserve the room for tomorrow, Mr. Azoth?"

5. It makes perfect sense to book the room, since I have no other place to sleep. If this inn, which is the simplest, is full, I will have to pay more at another one. "Yes, please book it for me for the next 7 days. It's almost all the money I have. By the way, what's your name, Kafra?" She smiled again, tilting her head to the side. "My name is Tayla, and it's a pleasure to have you as a guest, Mr. Azoth."

6. Her face and friendliness lit up the inn, and I felt impacted by her beauty. That smile enchanted me. "Thank you very much, Tayla. You do a great job here. I'm going now, see you later." She smiled again and said: "This is my first job, Mr. Azoth. I will do my best to please the customers. Have a great day." And so, I continued my way towards the Adventurers' Guild.

7. As I walked through the streets, I noticed that everything was different from before. Some people were still confused, trying to accept what was happening. It will take a while for everyone to adapt. This world is fascinating, but it is far from the technological level we had on Earth.

8. When I arrived at the Adventurers Guild, I noticed that there were a lot of people there. Different from last time. I approached the receptionist and said: "Hello, miss. Today I came to pick up my first quest to begin my journey as an adventurer."

9. She looked at me and, after a pause, looked around as if something was strange. I insisted: "Madam, can you show me the available quests?"

10. She rested her chin on her fingers and asked, "Did you come alone?"

11. "Yes, why?"

12. "Well, it'll be a bit difficult to find a good quest for you."

13. "Why?"

14. "With the large influx of new inhabitants, there were few quests left. We had a record number of adventurers signing up, many of them inexperienced and willing to take on high-level quests. So we had to impose some rules for the adventurers."

15. I had expected something like this. Had I made a mistake by not taking a quest yesterday? "What's available for me?" I asked. "On the board, you'll find F, E, and D rank quests. With the arrival of the new adventurers, we changed the rules. This is being implemented universally after the incident."

16. Probably all the inhabitants of Earth arrived here, and our arrival changed the structure of this world.

17. The rules work like this, the receptionist said: "F-rank quests, which usually involve killing Porings and collecting items, require at least two F- or G-rank adventurers. For E-rank quests, three members are required, with at least one of them being E-rank. D-rank quests require four members, with two of them being D-rank. However, there are still several G-rank quests left, simple tasks that can be done alone. They end up being left over because no one seems very interested. Are you interested in those?"

18. I definitely made a mistake by not taking a quest yesterday. With the increase in adventurers, they found a way to distribute the quests. "Miss, can I see the G-rank quests, please?"

19. "According to the Guild, each plant could tank around 10 hits from a apprentice, and they'd only deal 1 damage with each attack, which are pretty slow. With my initial HP of 50, I could deal 50 of their attacks, so I should be able to defeat quite a few of them. The quest was also perfect for me since I could use these herbs to make HP and SP potions from the level 1 Alchemy Manual."

20. Another thing is that these quests seemed perfect for me. In the Alchemy Level 1 manual I knew from my playing days, these herbs were essential for making HP and SP potions. Although I hadn't read any manuals in this world, I clearly remembered the formulas I used in the game, which could give me a head start.

21. The G-rank quests required me to collect 4 red herbs, 2 yellow herbs, and 2 green herbs. I had 3 days to complete the collection and the reward would be 120 zeny. It's a small amount, but considering that the lodging costs 100 zeny, I would still have 20 zeny to survive. I might be able to survive on that, excluding food expenses.

22. The first few days will be tough, but as I level up, things will get better. I picked up the G-rank quest. "Here you go. When you've collected all the items, return to the guild so we can add points to your adventurer score, and you'll be able to take on higher-level quests."

23. After leaving the guild, I decided to have a nice meal before heading out on the quests. The receptionist handed me a map with the locations of the plants I needed to collect. She mentioned that it was a good idea since I wouldn't need to spend money on portals since the plants were located on the outskirts of Einbroch.

24. After walking for a few minutes, I reached the entrance to the city. There were some heavily armed guards and a line of merchants entering. I didn't stop to observe, I continued towards the outskirts to look for the plants. After a while, I managed to find a red plant. I took out my knife and prepared for combat.

25. The combat was easy. I managed to land the 10 hits needed to defeat the plant, but I took 4 damage in total, leaving me with 46 HP. It attacked me with what seemed to be its arm, which turned into spikes when it touched me.

26. I continued hunting the plants for the rest of the day and, by the end, I had collected what I needed to complete the mission. I spent 8 hours killing the 32 plants. I was exhausted and hungry, but I managed to reach level 3. As expected, when I leveled up, my HP and SP were fully recovered. Now, I needed to go back and rest.

27. I opened my inventory and checked the items I had, there were quite a few items. In addition to the items needed to make potions, I found other items that I could sell and earn a good amount of money, and many of them that I could use to make cooking items that give some important buff. But one of these items, a plant called "mint", seemed promising. If I'm not mistaken, it is used to make painkillers and can activate the vigor skill. I need to go to the market to find out how much the mint is worth.

28. On the way back, I was torn between going straight to the adventurers' guild to turn in the quest or leaving it for the next day. I was very tired, but I didn't want to put it off, so I decided to head to the guild.

29. I arrived at the guild almost at night, and there weren't many people there. I went up to the receptionist, visibly exhausted. When she saw me, she waved and asked: "Hey, did you have a tiring day?"

30. I replied, leaning against the counter: "Yes, quite, but I managed to complete the mission. Here it is."

31. She praised him in his favor: "Not bad for a first mission. We usually give a deadline of 3 days because of the difficulty of finding these plants, but you seem to have done well."

32. "Here is your reward, 120 zeny." I politely thanked her and started to turn to leave, but she called out to me: "Azoth, I have some news for you."

33. I was so tired that I didn't want to hear any more, but I knew I needed to stay up to date with the information.

34. "As you may have noticed, there has been a huge increase in the number of adventurers, which has caused us some problems with the quests. If we hadn't organized ourselves, we wouldn't have been able to accommodate everyone."

35. "What's new is that the demand for quests like the one you completed has grown quite a bit recently. With the increase in the number of new adventurers, many of them have needed potions to complete their quests, which has ended up running out of stock on the market. This has caused the price of potions to skyrocket. Furthermore, since this type of quest—which usually involves gathering herbs and ingredients—is seen as boring and is often ignored by adventurers, they decided to increase the reward to attract more people. Now, they're paying four times as much. Are you interested in taking on more quests like this?"

36. As expected, as the number of adventurers increased, so would the demand for potions and ingredients to make them, which would cause prices to rise. I needed to get ahead of the game and take on as many of these types of quests as possible. "Please show me the available quests."

37. The receptionist smiled slightly and displayed the quests on a metal digital screen. "Take as many as you need, because tomorrow there might not be any more. Just remember to complete them within the deadline." This really worried me. I wanted to take on several quests, but I was afraid I wouldn't be able to finish them all in time. However, when I looked, I saw that there were quests of all types and deadlines.

38. I took on 5 quests, almost all of them with a 5-day deadline, and one with a 1-day deadline, which seemed quite advantageous. It asked for exactly the same items as today's quest, but paid three times as much: 400 zeny, while the others had good rewards but slightly lower pay.

39. The remaining 4 quests required 6 red herbs, 3 yellow herbs, and 3 green herbs each, all with a reward of 500 zeny. I'll have to dedicate the entire week to this. It may seem like I'm delaying the leveling process, but right now I need to prepare financially. If I have enough resources, I can join a strong group as support and gain experience without having to be a warrior, just by offering potions and helping out in the back.

40. Unlike other classes, until I become a full-fledged alchemist, I will basically be a workhorse for groups of adventurers or guilds. In the beginning, an alchemist needs a lot of resources, which are often easier to buy with money. Therefore, I need to quickly evolve to the merchant class, so I can get discounts in stores, sell at higher prices and use my bargaining skills like: Discount and Overpricing.

41. After all that, it was time to eat something and rest. I needed to prepare for the next day. As I was leaving the guild, I felt the need to thank the receptionist. "By the way, young lady, what's your name?"

42. She replied softly: "Rose."

43. "Thank you very much, Rose. See you later."

44. I always remember the people who helped me. This is something natural for me: to reward those who help me. Anyway, now I can go to the inn, but first I'll stop by for something to eat.
