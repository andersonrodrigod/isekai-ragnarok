My wounds began to close, and the exhaustion that had previously overwhelmed my body was replaced by a wave of relief. The Acolyte healing me had a calming aura, and the pain I felt soon disappeared. Still feeling a little weak, I turned my attention to the battle in front of me. It was then that I saw a warrior emerging from the shadows, attacking the monster. The sneaky strike hit with such power that it momentarily stunned the Vocal, staggering back. Before it could compose itself, the Swordsman took advantage of the opening and delivered a powerful thrust, his blade shining in the dim moonlight.

The Vocal roared in pain and rage, its claws moving frantically as it tried to return the attack. The Swordsman stood his ground, blocking the blows with his shield. Meanwhile, the Wizard in the background began to cast a new skill, his hands glowing with intense magical energy. Every word he uttered seemed to carry an ancient and imposing strength. The surrounding atmosphere began to heat up, the air vibrating with the power he was about to release. At the same time, the Acolyte, having restored some of my HP, joined the fight, her presence adding a new level of strategy to the combat.

The Vocal, even enraged, realized that it was surrounded and began to attack in a more chaotic way, launching its claws at everyone around it. The Swordsman managed to block most of the blows, but the monster's power was impressive, forcing him to retreat a little. The Thief moved with agility, dodging the attacks with agility. He attacked the monster in a vital spot, which caused it to roar once more, showing that his efforts were having an effect. Vocal was starting to lose ground, the fury in its eyes slowly being replaced by despair.

Then, the Wizard finally released his magic. Fire Spears fell onto Vocal, engulfing it in a vortex of fire. The monster tried to resist, but the group's coordinated attacks were too much for it. The swordsman delivered the final blow, his sword piercing Vocal's heart. With one last roar, the monster fell to the ground, defeated. The battle was over, and silence once again dominated the forest.

After the fight ended, the swordsman approached me, his serious expression softening as he extended his hand. "Are you okay?" he asked, his voice carrying a tone of concern.

Still feeling the relief of having narrowly escaped, I took a deep breath before responding. "Yes, I'm fine... it was just a big scare." I tried to sound calm, but the truth was that my heart was still racing, and the cold sweat on my skin hinted at how close I had come to the worst.

The Swordsman raised an eyebrow, his curiosity evident. "But what happened? Why are you alone in this area, and at night?" He seemed intrigued, and rightly so.

"I made a miscalculation," I began to explain, still a little embarrassed by the oversight. "I spotted an Elusive Rocker and it was getting late. It ended up taking me longer than I expected to defeat it, and when I finally did, I had to run away from a Vocal to the opposite direction of the camp. When I lost it, it was night already, and while trying to go back through the darkness, I got ambushed by another Vocal."

He chuckled lightly, shaking his head in friendly disapproval. "And you came here without a torch? It's always good to carry one, especially when going out alone. You never know what might happen." His tone was friendly, but with a hint of reprimand. "But anyway, what's your name?"

"My name is Azoth," I replied, calmer now. "And honestly, I'm really grateful for your help. I would have died by now if you hadn't come."

The Swordsman smiled, relaxing his shoulders. "It was really close." He pointed at the wizard, who was still a little away. "I'm Drakon, that one over there is Elarius." The wizard gave a discreet nod, without saying a word. "The sneaky one is Noctis." The Thief gave a subtle nod, an air of mystery enveloping him. "And the Acolyte who healed you... Kaelyn." Drakon's voice softened as he said her name, and Kaelyn, with a cute smile, waved at me. "Pleasure to meet you!" Her voice was sweet and welcoming.

They were all young and looked the same age as me. I returned the smile. "It's a pleasure to meet you all. Truly, thank you for saving my life." I said genuinely. I was now heavily indebted to them.

Drakon, now more relaxed, crossed his arms. "We don't usually hunt at night, but as there are many adventurers in the area, it's difficult to find good monsters to level up, so we had to stretch it a bit into the night. What about you, Azoth, what is your objective?"

"Well, I want to reach level 20 soon so I can try to join the Viperspire Guild. They are recruiting now."

Drakon smiled, not very surprised. "You too? We're also looking to join it." He looked around and noticed that the environment was still dangerous. "You wanna go back to the camp with us?"

"Yes, please." I replied, somewhat embarrassed.

Drakon nodded. "Then let's hurry. Staying here for too long could be dangerous."

On the way back, Drakon shared a little more about the group. He explained that most of them were around level 16, while Kaelyn and Noctis were still level 15. He also warned me."You know, it's not very suitable to go solo on expeditions, especially when you don't have many resources, items or equipment," Drakon said with a serious tone. "Some new adventurers from noble families can venture alone to a certain extent, but even they eventually need to join in a group."

I kept talking with the group thoughout the journey, and realized they were a very wholesome group. After a long walk through the dense and mysterious jungle, we finally reached the campsite. I watched the group heading towards the tents and took a deep breath, coming to a decision. I approached Drakon, who was busy organizing some equipment.

"Drakon," I called out, my voice firm with determination. "I’d like to join your team. It no longer makes sense for me to hunt alone after my near-death experience. You saved my life, and I intend to repay that debt somehow."

Drakon looked up in surprise, but soon gave me a welcoming smile. "Sure, why not? You got along with everyone in the group. You'll be a great addition. We might even be able to tackle a more challenging zone; we’ve been here for two days and planned on staying for a while longer, but with you, we can get to a better zone sooner" he said, pointing to an organized area with tents, "We're camping over there."

A genuine smile spread across my face. “Thank you, I'll make sure to help you guys develop faster.” The gratitude was clear in my voice. He nodded in approval.

Drakon nodded, satisfied, and we headed towards the tents together. As we walked, I couldn't shake the feeling that, for the first time in a long time, I was among real people, and that Drakon, with his genuine manner and natural leadership, could be the start of something special. That night would be calmer, with allies by my side.

Noctis like to keep it to himself. Elarius, the Wizard, was constantly immersed in his studies, always with a book in his hands, while Kaelyn seemed to be the heart of the group, taking care of everyone like a big sister.

That night, while some were already sleeping, I stayed talking to Drakon around the fire. He seemed curious about me, especially when I mentioned I was an Otherworlder. His eyes widened with surprise and interest.

"An Otherworlder? So, you're from Earth?" he asked, with a mix of curiosity and fascination.

I nodded, and from then on, he didn't stop asking questions about my world. I spoke about Earth, describing the technological advances we had there, from machines to the internet. Drakon listened attentively, enchanted, as if I were telling stories from a legendary kingdom.

"So you guys built that thing called... the internet?"

"Yeah. But in addition, we have cars, which are motorized vehicles, like carriages without horses, that allow us to travel quickly from one place to another. The millitary have armored vehicles, which are able to travel through uneven terrain while carrying big weapons."

"That sounds very helpful. On a long expedition, that's a huge advantage. We have portals, which are greater than everything, but they demand a strong infrastructure and are quite expensive to build and maintain, so they can only be used for long distance travel since the GateWatchers keep portals everywhere."

"Yeah. And with the arrival of others like me in this world, I think it's only a matter of time before the technology here moves in that direction too."

Drakon considered for a moment, his expression changing to something more serious. "You know, this gives me hope, but it also worries me. There are a lot of xenophobic people out there, who don't like this invasion of the Otherworlders. Some fear what you bring, while others see it as a big opportunity."

He paused before continuing. "My father, for instance, lost some work because of this. Otherworlders have introduced revolutionary knowledge in metallurgy and craftsmanship that didn’t exist here. He’s both excited and concerned. Competition will be intense. Those who don't adapt and improve risk being left behind, but those that do, a world of opportunity will open up for them."

I could see the mixture of hope and apprehension in Drakon's eyes. The idea of ​​a different future made him anxious, but he seemed to believe there was potential for something great.

We talked about various things for a while longer, laughing and discussing possibilities, until tiredness finally caught up with us. "We'll decide what we're going to do tomorrow," Drakon said, yawning. "For now, it's time to rest. We'll need it for tomorrow."

I agreed and laid down, feeling an unusual peace being close to people who seemed to share the same wavelength as me.
