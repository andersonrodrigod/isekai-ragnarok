1. My wounds began to close, and the exhaustion that had previously overwhelmed my body was replaced by a wave of relief. The novice healing me had a calming aura, and the pain I felt soon disappeared. Still feeling a little weak, I turned my attention to the battle in front of me. It was then that I saw a warrior emerging from the shadows, attacking Vocal with precision. The sneaky strike hit the monster with such speed that it was momentarily stunned, staggering back. Before Vocal could compose himself, the swordsman took advantage of the opening and delivered a powerful thrust, his blade shining in the dim moonlight.

2. Vocal roared in pain and rage, his claws moving frantically as he tried to return the attack. The swordsman stood his ground, blocking the blows with his shield. Meanwhile, the wizard in the background began to cast a new skill, his hands glowing with intense magical energy. Every word he uttered seemed to carry an ancient and imposing strength. The surrounding atmosphere began to heat up, the air vibrating with the power he was about to release. At the same time, the novice, having restored some of my HP, joined the fight, her presence adding a new level of strategy to the combat.

3. Vocal, even enraged, realized that he was surrounded and began to attack in a more chaotic way, launching his claws at everyone around him. The swordsman managed to block most of the blows, but the monster's power was impressive, forcing him to retreat a little. The thief moved with agility, dodging attacks with precision. She attacked the monster in a vital spot, which caused it to roar once more, showing that her efforts were having an effect. Vocal was starting to lose ground, the fury in his eyes slowly being replaced by despair.

4. Then, the wizard finally released his magic. Fire Spears fell onto Vocal, engulfing him in a vortex of fire. The monster tried to resist, but the group's coordinated attacks were too much for it. The swordsman delivered the final blow, his sword piercing Vocal's heart. With one last roar, the monster fell to the ground, defeated. The battle was over, and silence once again dominated the forest.

5. After the fight ended, the swordsman approached me, his serious expression softening as he extended his hand. "Are you well?" he asked, his voice carrying a tone of concern.

6. Still feeling the relief of having narrowly escaped, I took a deep breath before responding. "Yes, I'm fine... it was just a scare." I tried to sound calm, but the truth was that my heart was still racing, and the cold sweat on my skin gave away how close I had come to the worst.

7. The swordsman raised an eyebrow, his curiosity evident. "But what happened? Why are you alone in this area, and at night?" He seemed intrigued, and rightly so.

8. "I made a miscalculation," I began to explain, still a little embarrassed by the oversight. "I spotted an Elusive Rocker and it was getting late. It ended up taking me longer than I expected to defeat it, and when I finally did, night had already fallen. After that, I couldn't navigate the jungle anymore."

9. He chuckled lightly, shaking his head in friendly disapproval. "And you came here without a torch? It's always good to carry one, especially when going out alone. You never know what might happen." His tone was friendly, but with a hint of reprimand. "But anyway, what's your name?"

10. "My name is Azoth," I replied, calmer now. "And honestly, thank you so much for your help. Without you, I might not be here to tell the story."

11. The swordsman smiled, relaxing his shoulders. "It was really close." He pointed at the wizard, who was still a little away. "I'm Drakon, that one over there is Elarius." The wizard gave a discreet nod, without saying a word. "The one with the sneak attack is Noctis." The thief made a slight gesture of his head, with a mysterious air. "And the novice who healed you...Kaelyn." Drakon's voice softened as he said her name, and Kaelyn, with a cute smile, waved at me. "Pleasure to meet you!" His voice was sweet and welcoming.

12. They were all young and looked the same age as me. I returned the smile. "It's a pleasure to meet you all. Truly, thank you so much for everything." My gratitude was genuine; Without them, my journey would have ended tragically that night.

13. Drakon, now more relaxed, crossed his arms. "We don't usually hunt at night, but as there are many adventurers in the area, it's difficult to find good monsters to evolve. And you, Azoth, what is your objective?"

14. "Well, I want to reach level 20 soon so I can try to join the Viperspire Guild. They are recruiting now."

15. Drakon smiled, surprised by the coincidence. "You too? How lucky! We're keeping an eye on this guild too." He looked around and noticed that the environment was still dangerous. "Were you trying to get back to camp?"

16. "Yes, I was," I replied, somewhat embarrassed. "But because of that I got lost."

17. Drakon nodded with understanding. "Then let's hurry. Staying here for too long could be dangerous. You never know what might come around these parts at night."

18. On the way back, Drakon shared a little more about the group. He explained that most of them were around level 16, while Kaelyn and Noctis were still level 15. He also gave me some valuable tips. "You know, it's not very suitable to go solo on expeditions, especially when you don't have many resources, items or equipment," Drakon said with a serious tone. "Some adventurers from noble families can venture alone to a certain extent, but even they eventually need to do so in a group."

19. He continued, explaining something I didn't know. "These nobles participate in an annual event called the Draft. All children of nobles, up to the age of 20, compete, and the guilds are there, offering great rewards to attract the best. It's a dream to be recruited like this... but, how can I not If I'm rich or noble, my best chance is to join a big, strong guild early on." His voice carried a certain aspiration, a desire to belong to something greater, even if the path was different from the one the nobles followed.

20. After a long walk through the dense and mysterious jungle, we finally arrived at the camp. I watched the group head toward their tents, and I hesitated, thinking about letting them go on without me. Before I could walk away, Drakon noticed my hesitation and turned around. "What's your tent? Or are you leaving?" He asked, with a curious expression.

21. I was a little embarrassed, but I answered. "I plan to rent a tent around here and spend the night. Tomorrow, I want to continue hunting and gain more experience." My voice carried a mix of indecision and determination, unsure if I should go it alone again.

22. Drakon looked at me with a welcoming smile and extended the invitation. "Why don't you join us? We're camped over there," he gestured with his thumb to a neatly organized area. "We've been here for two days now and we'll stay for two more. If you want to be part of the group, you'd be most welcome. With you, perhaps we can venture into a more challenging area."

23. A genuine smile appeared on my face. "I didn't want to disturb or delay you," I said, a little embarrassed, but gratitude was evident in my voice. "But it would be amazing to join you. I really appreciate the offer."

24. Drakon nodded, satisfied, and we headed towards the tents together. As we walked, I couldn't shake the feeling that, for the first time in a long time, I was among real people, and that Drakon, with his genuine manner and natural leadership, could be the start of something special. That night would be calmer, with allies by my side.

25. shadow. Elarius, the wizard, was constantly immersed in his studies, always with a book in his hands, and Kaelyn, with her sweetness and maternal concern, seemed to be the emotional heart of the group, always ready to take care of everyone like a true mother.

26. That night, while some were already sleeping, I stayed talking to Drakon around the fire. He seemed curious about me, especially when I mentioned I was an Otherworlder. His eyes widened with surprise and interest.

27. "An Otherworlder? So, you're from Earth?" he asked, with a mix of curiosity and fascination.

28. I nodded, and from then on, he didn't stop asking questions about my world. I spoke about Earth, describing the technological advances we had there, from machines to the internet. Drakon listened attentively, enchanted, as if I were telling stories from a legendary kingdom.

29. "Do you really have something called... the internet? That connects everyone, no matter where they are?" he asked, impressed.

30. "Yes, exactly. Communication has become almost instantaneous, as if it were the messaging system you have from the government but for free" I replied with a smile. "But in addition, we have cars, which are motorized vehicles that allow us to travel quickly from one place to another, regardless of distance. They make getting around much easier and faster."

31. Drakon's eyes widened. "So you can move from place to place at high speed? That should make things a lot easier!"

32. "Absolutely! And with the arrival of others like me in this world, I think it's only a matter of time before the technology here moves in that direction too."

33. Drakon considered for a moment, his expression changing to something more serious. "You know, this gives me hope, but it also worries me. There are a lot of xenophobic people out there, who don't like this invasion of the Otherworlders. Some fear what you bring, while others try to take advantage of your abilities."

34. He paused before continuing. "My father, for example, lost some customers because of this. With the knowledge of Otherworlders, especially those who understand metallurgy and craftsmanship, creating equipment will become easier and faster. Many local artisans will find it difficult but it will also be times learning to evolve together"

35. I could see the mixture of hope and apprehension in Drakon's eyes. The idea of ​​a different future made him anxious, but he seemed to believe there was potential for something great.

36. We talked about various things for a while longer, laughing and discussing possibilities, until tiredness finally caught up with us. "Tomorrow, we decide what we're going to do," Drakon said, yawning. "But for today, let's rest. We need strength for what lies ahead."

37. I agreed, lying down next to them, feeling an unusual peace when being next to people who, despite being so different, seemed to share the same adventurous spirit as me.
