Elarius started by explaining the basics, and as he spoke, I listened attentively to confirm my suspicions — after all, if the system was the same as the game, it would be a relief. As I imagined, it was very similar, but with some crucial differences: to equip cards to items, you had to be from an advanced class like Arch-Mage or Professor, and they charged a specific fee for the service.

I already expected him to mention some cost, but a doubt still lingered in my mind. I rested my chin between my fingers and asked:
"What is the price for a mage to do this card allocation on equipment? Is there a specific skill involved in this?"

Elarius responded, gesturing enthusiastically:
"I'll probably be taught how to do this at my next class change. From what I've heard, it's not a special ability — any wizard can learn it, but when they become Arch-Mage or Professor, they take an oath that this technique cannot be taught to anyone outside of the mage class evolutions." (He explained it as someone with knowledge that he values).

There seemed to be, then, a system of loyalty between classes in this world. Apparently, equipping cards shouldn't be such a complex process, but it still had its requirements. This sparked my curiosity. I would like to explore more skills, perhaps even circumvent this restrictive system — after all, my nature has always been to question and explore limits.

The conversation ended when we finally arrived close to the camp, and the sky was already beginning to turn dark with twilight. Each continued reflecting on the last battles and with a renewed purpose.

As soon as we arrived, Drakon announced that he would go to the Viperspire Guild Mansion to sign up, now that he had reached level 20. Seeing an opportunity, I asked:
"Can I go with you?"

He hesitated for a moment, still a little reserved, but eventually agreed. While the others went to the tent to rest, Drakon and I headed towards the mansion together.

---

When we arrived at the mansion, Drakon went straight to the missions panel, checking what he could do the next day and in which area of ​​the Jungle, on the Plains of Prontera. I noticed his excitement, but I interrupted:

“Drakon, wait. Don't you think it's better to register first and then we can evaluate what we're going to do tomorrow? After all, perhaps only guild members will have access to all the benefits unlocked on this panel.”

He stopped for a moment, reflecting, and then nodded:
"You're right. This panel probably holds a lot of features that only members can access. I'll sign up first."

Drakon headed to the registration line, which, unlike the last time I was there, was much busier, with new members arriving every moment. In fact, many "Otherworlders" — as they called those who came from other worlds — had already reached level 20, and my recent team experience confirmed that leveling up was much faster in a group.

After registering, Drakon was taken to a room inside the mansion, while I waited in the entrance hall. Time passed slowly, but finally he appeared, looking for me in the crowd. When he saw me, he raised his hand as a sign and came towards me. Without containing my curiosity, I immediately asked:

"So, how was it in there?"

Drakon sighed and replied:
"Well, they did an interview with me, asked if I was an Otherworlder, where I lived, and if I was already connected to another guild. I explained that I wasn't. Then they said that I officially joined, but that new level 20 members have goals to comply with, and if they do not achieve them, they will be expelled from the guild. One of the goals is to transcend class within a maximum period of two years."

"Just that? So joining the guild doesn’t bring any benefits?” — I asked, in disbelief.

"No, it has many benefits," he continued, with a twinkle of enthusiasm in his eyes. "For example, that panel... Now we will have access to a detailed map of the monsters, including their status and dropped items. But there is a challenge: we need to release the maps for all zones of the Plains of Prontera to then release the rest. Viperspire has camps on many of these maps and organizes members to evolve as quickly as possible."

----

Drakon continued excitedly, "They said that now I need to form a group. If all the members are from our guild, we will participate in an internal ranking, based on the number of missions completed and the difficulty of the monsters defeated. With good positioning, our group can be summoned to face big bosses alongside other groups and win rare items. Furthermore, when a dungeon controlled by allied guilds appears, the highest ranking groups can be invited to explore it."

This information raised several doubts in my mind. 'What do you mean a dungeon appears and some guilds are responsible for them? If the guilds themselves control entry, how can others participate?' Uneasy, I asked: "Explain this story of guilds controlling the entrance to dungeons. There are few that appear, right?"

Drakon, noticing my confusion, replied: "When a dungeon appears, the guilds are notified, and whoever arrives first gets to control the area, often without giving other guilds the opportunity to take over. Many dungeons end up being controlled by an alliance of five to fifteen guilds, which organize themselves to avoid unnecessary conflicts. Thus, the guild that first claimed or found the dungeon has priority to explore without interference."

"That makes sense, but considering that few dungeons appear each year, some guilds end up being left out, right?" I asked.

"Yes, but now we are in the period of the Crystal Break event, which brings a lot of uncertainty. There are rumors that dungeons will appear much more frequently, and will be larger and more challenging. This may require the participation of more guilds involved in larger alliances , but for now, these are all just rumors."

This information that Drakon brought is precious and rekindles my desire to evolve. I need to make the most of these peak years of the Crystal Break event. Being part of a guild at this time is essential, and with the addition of Rox we will certainly have a complete team. Of course, there are still some classes I would like to take, but I can plan for that better when I become an alchemist. With enough resources, I will be able to attract new members, and if we continue completing missions and defeating stronger monsters, we will be ranked well, attracting the attention of more powerful figures. I can see a great plan for the future.

After discussing the benefits of the guild, Drakon and I went to the Digital Panel. Now with some resources unlocked, we will be able to better define the future of our group, both in terms of finances and experience.

When looking at the available maps, I realized that I wouldn't want to repeat the same Zone 10 where we were. The ideal would be to explore an area with average monsters and some mini-bosses that drop valuable items and give good experience. Zone 11 seemed like the perfect choice, with a variety of monsters and, finally, goblins — meaning we'll now face humanoid monsters, which can pose a strategic challenge to our group.

Furthermore, with the panel unlocked, I can see the items that each monster drops and the selling price. A goblin, for example, can drop a shield worth around 7 thousand Zenys. If I manage to get one of these, not only will I pay the costs of this expedition, I will also make a good profit, in addition to the experience we will gain.

After analyzing the maps, I turned to Drakon and said firmly, "Tomorrow we are going to Zone 11. There, we will face monsters with more potential, and I am confident that if everyone follows my instructions, we will leave there at level 20."

Drakon, however, was reticent. "Azoth, I think you're overestimating our capabilities. We just almost got defeated in a relatively easy zone, and now you want us to go to an even more dangerous area?" He responded by crossing his arms, showing concern.

I knew that past experience had left its mark on Drakon, but I was there to support him and help him get through it. "Drakon, there's no need to worry," I replied, trying to reassure him. "You have me. If you trust my support and follow my instructions, we can beat whoever I say."

Drakon agreed, so we headed to the tent, ready to start another journey tomorrow.
