1. After leaving the Adventurers' Guild, we headed towards the imposing mansion that stood in front of the main square of Einbroch. That was where the Portal Watchers (Gatewatchers' Guild soa melhor) were. As we approached, I noticed that there didn't seem to be any sort of charge to enter, which was a relief (mas não é dito mais pra frente que tem um custo? remove essa parte.

2. As soon as we walked through the door, I was immediately struck by the stark difference from the rest of the city. Einbroch, with its dirty, dark environment marked by cyberpunk-style industrial chaos, was in complete contrast to what I saw before me. The mansion looked otherworldly. The walls were covered in white marble, polished to reflect the soft light from the crystal chandeliers that hung from the ceiling. The floor gleamed, made of a material that looked like granite, and imposing columns stretched to the high ceiling, supporting the structure as if it were a palace.

3. Rox, next to me, seemed enchanted by the architecture, admiring the refined details of the spiral staircases, the colorful stained glass that adorned the windows, and the luxurious furnishings that filled the main hall. Everything here exuded wealth and power.

4. While he was still taking in the grandeur of the place, I went straight to the nearby reception desk, determined to find out and ask how we could use the portal.

5. As I approached the man wearing elegant, well-groomed clothes suited to the sophisticated atmosphere of that mansion — a dark velvet vest over an impeccable white shirt and linen pants, completed by polished leather boots — he approached me first with a sharp smile.

6. “Let me guess… new explorers?” he said, resting his chin between his fingers in a relaxed manner, as if he was already used to this type of encounter.

7. “Yes, and we would like to use the portal to the plains of Prontera. Can you help us?” I replied, gesturing to emphasize the request.

8. “Of course, but first, I need to inform you about the fees for using the portals. Allow me to introduce myself: I am Cassius, the sentry responsible for the portals of Einbroch,” he said, with an air of professionalism, while crossing his arms, showing an expression of someone who had complete control over the place.

9. Cassius explained that there was a price difference between portals that lead to cities and warp portals. For city portals, the standard fee was one thousand Zenys, with the exception of Prontera, where the costs were even higher (diz logo o preço). For the Prontera plains, next to the Viperspire Camp — the most influential guild in the region — the cost was much lower, just 200 Zenys per person. Additionally, we would receive a ticket linked to our Status Board, allowing us to return at no additional cost through the portal. However, this ticket could not be used on portals to cities (como assim, o qq esse ticket faz exatamente? bom colocar o Cassius falando).

10. The price seemed fair, although I suspected that the higher charge to access the cities had some greater purpose — perhaps strict control over who entered, to avoid riots or problems within urban areas.

11. "Okay, me and my friend here are going to want to go to Prontera Plains," he said, gesturing to Rox (ele vai pra prontera mesmo? ele tem 10k zeny? vale a pena gastar toda essa grana? porque que ele não vai pra selva de prontera que é mais barata? corrigido mudei pra Prontera Plains).

12. Rox (Rox é um nome muito feminino) nodded to the sentry, who then led us to a spot where there was a portal marked on the ground. He explained that once we positioned ourselves in the center, we would automatically be transported to the Prontera Plains.

13. As soon as I followed Cassius' instructions and positioned myself in the center of the portal, the sensation of displacement was almost imperceptible, as if the air around me had distorted for a moment. When the magical effects stopped, I found myself in an entirely different scenario.

14. It was as if I (mudou pra terceira pessoa do nada pq? corrigido) had been transported directly to the heart of a large jungle, where the guild camp was set up. The sun was still low in the sky, illuminating the vast plains in the distance, and for the first time since I arrived, I saw the sky clear, without the thick smoke that enveloped the city of Einbroch. Birds flew serenely above, cutting the sky in smooth lines, and all across the horizon, huge trees stretched, some covered in dense foliage, while others revealed the vastness of the plain.

15. The atmosphere was fresh and, unlike the industrial city, here there was a feeling of freedom and calm, as if nature itself was in tune with the adventurers preparing to explore the jungle. The camp, with its various tents and tents, had a military vibe, with sturdy, well-organized structures. It was clear that there weren't just adventurers here; there was also an organized force, prepared for any type of combat that the jungle required.

16. In a corner, to the left, an imposing large house stood out. The name "Viperspire Mansion" was carved into a dark wooden sign, and the structure appeared to be the logistical heart of the camp. Inside the mansion, you could see accommodation and a tavern — essential areas for rest and socialization among adventurers.

17. As I walked between the stalls, I noticed that the atmosphere here was very different to Einbroch. People's clothes reflected a more militarized style, more resistant and adapted for direct combat, without the urban adornments I saw on the city streets. Most seemed to be there for a single purpose: struggle, exploration and survival.

18. Without attracting much attention, I continued towards the reception, feeling the atmosphere of discipline and military power that permeated the air of the camp. As soon as I entered the Viperspire Mansion, I entered a large, busy room. At all times, people came and went, some carrying heavy equipment, others seeming to discuss battle strategies. The environment, despite the hustle and bustle, seemed organized, almost meticulously planned to support the routine of adventurers and warriors.

19. Just to my right, something caught my eye: a digital board, unlike anything I had seen before in the world of adventurers. The technology there blended with the rustic environment in a strangely harmonious way. At the top of the screen, a constantly rotating slide displayed the quests with the highest rewards, highlighted in bright, eye-catching fonts. Each mission had details such as location, type of monster and promised reward, some of them offering tempting prices for anyone willing to risk their lives on the plains or in the dungeons.

20. At the bottom of the board, various other information scrolled, organized into sections. There, it was possible to see news about the guild's recent achievements, updates on members' rankings and achievements, and a list of available quests, with the option to directly select the desired mission. This panel seemed to be the administrative heart of the place, a digital hub that facilitated the flow of information and kept all adventurers updated on the dangers and opportunities around them.

21. The innovation was clear: a camp that combined tradition with technology to maintain control of its operations and ensure that the riskiest missions were always the most targeted.

22. Curious to know more about the quests, I approached the digital panel and tried to interact with the mission options. The system was modern and intuitive, but as soon as I selected a mission that looked interesting, a pop-up window appeared on the screen, blocking my access. The message clearly said:

23. "Access denied. Please come to reception for further information."

24. I sighed, frustrated, but decided to follow the instructions. Maybe there was some red tape to be sorted out before I could sign up for a mission. I turned towards the reception, which was just ahead. The line wasn't that long, but the constant flow of adventurers gave me the feeling that there would always be something to solve.

25. As soon as I reached the counter, a man with a thick beard and tired eyes greeted me with a nod. He wore a military uniform, but with the carefree air of someone used to the routine of the place. His firm posture indicated that he was someone with a certain authority there.

26. “Do you need something?” he asked, his voice hoarse but friendly.

27. "Yes, I tried to use the digital panel to get a quest, but I was blocked. A pop-up instructed me to come here." I replied, pointing to the panel at the back of the room.

28. "Ah, of course (removi a parte inútil). I'm Rivory, the Questkeeper. I'm responsible for managing the quests and missions here at Viperspire." He stroked his beard before continuing. "That panel is exclusive to official guild members. Only they have direct access to missions through the digital system."

29. "So how do I get a quest?"

30. Rivory gestured toward the opposite side of the room, where a blonde woman, dressed more casually, was sitting behind another counter, chatting with some other adventurers.

31. "You'll have to talk to Mary. She takes care of beginner adventurers. She'll explain how everything works and what you need to get started. Any quest you do under our protection will go through her."

32. I thanked Rivory and turned to Mary, ready to find out what I would need to do to finally get a quest. However, something bothered me. Is Viperspire really a legitimate guild? If so, that changed the perspective I had on these organizations a little.

33. Until then, when Rose explained to me about legitimate guilds, I imagined that they all functioned like military forces, with the main objective of ensuring order and protecting the lands of a place (a explicação da Rose não passou essa impressão). However, it seemed that Viperspire went beyond that. Not only did it maintain considerable military power, it also acted as an adventurers' guild, opening up possibilities for a variety of goals and missions, ranging from combat to exploration. This made me realize that legitimate guilds could be more versatile and multifaceted than I had imagined.

34. As Rox (essa parte aqui tava vazia, corrigido) and I approached Mary, extending my hand in greeting. "Hi, I'm Azoth, and this is Rox" I introduced myself with a smile. Mary returned the greeting, but her expression seemed to carry a slight wear.

35. "New adventurers, huh?" She paused and let out a sigh. "This week has been crazy. It seems like the Otherworlders event has made the world too small for everyone. There are a lot of people adventuring here, I don't know how we're going to keep up."

36. I took the moment to ask, curiously, "So, what exactly do I need to know or have to explore these plains of Prontera?"

37. Mary seemed to ponder for a moment, her eyes fixed on the digital board in front of her, as if she were weighing her words. Then, without further delay, he closed his eyes, took a deep breath, and finally said in a serious tone, "Okay, I'll start." (estranho todo esse ritual mas sei lá, dependendo do motivo...)
