1. On the way back, as I entered the street where the inn were located, I noticed that there was some confusion in several of them. However, as I was exhausted, I didn't stop to notice the details and went straight to my inn. The simple but adequate "Yellow House" was waiting for me.

2. As I entered, I realized that the situation at the inn was not calm either. There was a lot of confusion and many people were shouting at Tayla, the kafra in charge of the place. Despite everything, she kept her charming smile and continued to speak politely to the complainants, which made me empathize with her. I approached to see what was going on.

3. When I got closer, a man with an aggressive tone said to Tayla: "How come a hostel as bad as this doesn't have a room available? It's already the tenth hostel I've entered and they're all full, what a shitty city that keeps accepting these fucking  immigrants"

4. Tayla, with her persistent smile and a bead of sweat running down her face, replied: "Sir, I apologize, but due to the arrival of new inhabitants from all over the world, we are facing overcrowding. We are doing our best to adapt to this situation."

5. The situation was complicated. I hadn’t anticipated this kind of problem. In my rush to resolve other matters, I didn't pay attention to the impacts of the mass migration on this world. Ignoring the screams, I approached the reception desk to ask for my key.

6. When Tayla saw me, her face lit up with relief, and she called out to me: “Azoth, please, I need to talk to you. Let’s go inside”

7. I ignored the commotion that was still going on in the reception area. The people waiting in the reception area continued to shout, but nothing could change what was happening. We entered the room and Tayla stopped me in front of her. I was mesmerized by her eyes. There was something charming about her that made me want to say something positive.

8. She took a deep breath and continued, "You've noticed what's happening in the world, right? People have arrived out of nowhere, and we're facing overcrowding. The price for a room is now far higher than what you paid"

9. The overcrowding, was affecting the lodging. Fortunately, I had already paid for seven days in advance.

10. Tayla clasped her hands together, with an expression that she was willing to do anything to get me to accept her proposal. "We've found a way to deal with this situation. Not all guests have accepted, but if you accept, we'll compensate you. Since you've already paid for seven days of your stay, we could extend it. The current price for a room is 400 zeny per day, but if you agree to share the room with another guest, we'll keep the price at 200 zeny per day for a month."

11. I expected the prices to increase, but what she proposed to me was an advantageous offer. Not only for me, but also for them, since the inn was full. If they accepted more guests, they would profit from the higher charge, without having to drive away current guests. For me, it was a great solution, since it would keep the same price for longer. I didn't know how long this overcrowding would last, but I believed that eventually the prices would go down.

12. "Will you accept?" Tayla asked, touching her index finger to the other, her face slightly flushed.

13. I thought about it for a moment. "Yes, that's a good proposal. However, there's one condition: that I don't have to share a room with dangerous adventurers. I don't want to risk anything while I sleep."

14. With a relieved smile, Tayla replied: "Don't worry, Azoth. Before accepting any guest, we check the status plate to make sure they're not criminals. We don't accept outlaws."

15. This issue of the status plate was on my mind. I knew that I could obtain information about a person through a status plate, a sort of metal panel. This panel showed class, guild, group and completed missions, but there was other data that I couldn't access and would probably need to pay to obtain. The daily newspaper was also blocked, which is of utmost importance to keep me informed, and there was also the ranking and other information, but it wasn't something relevant to me at the moment. Still, I needed to research more about the accesses to this status plate.

16. Although I hadn't prepared for this kind of situation, I had been smart to rush through other tasks on the first day. Maybe my mistake was not taking a mission earlier, but overall, the ones I chose were good.

17. I was exhausted, I could barely stand. My body was asking for rest, and I wanted to get out of there as quickly as possible. "I'll leave it to you, then. I'll be sleeping in the meantime."

18. Tayla replied: "Don't worry, we've already sorted it out."

19. After hearing that, I grabbed my room key and quickly went to take a shower, getting ready to rest. As I lay down, before falling into a deep sleep, I heard the voice of an elderly man entering the inn. He seemed to be thanking someone other than Tayla for the stay.

20. I woke up in the morning and realized that the bed where the other guest was sleeping was empty. "He left very early," I thought. While I was getting ready for the shower, I took the opportunity to check my status board.

21. In the game, when I wanted to access my inventory, I did so through a virtual screen, but here it's a little different. Through the board, I can see all the items I have in my inventory, and to pick them up, I just click on the desired item and it automatically comes to my hand. I can carry up to 40 pieces of equipment and 40 items, which seems like a lot, but on a dungeon run, that can be a limited number. It would be nice if the storage space could be increased, but I don't think it would be possible since there was no such option in the game.

22. I currently have 16 items in my inventory. Although some of them are useless, I decided not to sell them for now, since there are also items that I can use later. When I reach the first merchant class, I will be able to sell some items, the useless ones, for a higher price in the stores. At the moment, I also don't see any need to use the Kafra service, which, like in the game, would allow me to store 50 pieces of equipment and 50 items, in addition to enabling upgrades to access my items from anywhere in the world. When I need it, I will certainly learn more about how it works.

23. I can also see all the equipment I am using and their attributes. Right now, I am equipped with a knife that gives me 17 attack strength and a cotton shirt that gives me 10 armor. In addition, I can check the status of my attributes. When I level up, two angel wings appear above my head, indicating the improvement. At this point, I can only think about which attributes I will distribute the points to; I only put one point in dexterity. I decided to save the points for later, since I don't know if I can reset the attributes like in the game, so for now I'll save these points for later.

24. There are other features on the status board that I still need to explore, but for now I'm going to prepare myself for a meal. Today, I'll spend the whole day in the outskirts, completing the adventurer's guild quests.

25. I went to the outskirts to kill the plants and collect the items they dropped, and I ended up with a collection progression.

26. Today was much easier. I managed to kill 36 plants in 8 hours, 12 of each color. I completed the mission quickly, still having 2 red herbs and 3 green ones left, which I will use for the next missions. With another 4 days to go, if I continue at this pace, I will be able to finish on time, maybe even a day early, and I will even be able to advance one more level, reaching level 4. Since I'm tired, I'll stop here.

27. When I arrived at the guild, I picked up my reward and, without delay, went to the inn. This time, unlike yesterday, there was no commotion, which indicated that the problem had been solved. The new kafra was different from Tayla, smiling, but she seemed older.

28. "Hello, miss, could I have the key to room 21?", I asked politely.

29. "Of course, you are Azoth, right? Thanks for accepting the deal, it helped a lot with the overcrowding."

30. "It was nothing, it was good for me too," I replied shortly, and went straight to my room.

31. When I got to my room, I noticed that the door was already open. When I entered, I found a man, apparently about 45 years old, with strong arms and an iron smell. He seemed quite imposing and watched me for a moment while I sat down, but then he got up.

32. "Are you Azoth?" he asked.

33. "Yeah that's me," I replied.

34. "Thanks for sharing your room.. I live in a town nearby called Einbech, a mining town. We collect minerals there, and sometimes I come to supply what we collect."

35. The smell of iron and the strength of the man now made sense. I decided to ask, "Are you a blacksmith?"

36. He straightened up, patting his chest with both hands and said, "Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't even introduce myself. My name is Balack. I'm a blacksmith, I started late in the profession. At my age, I should be a master blacksmith by now, or even a mechanic."

37. Sharing a room with this man seemed like a good opportunity. Casual conversation wasn't common here, but I had already had conversations like that with Tayla and Rose. I needed to strengthen my circle of friends if I wanted to adapt well to this world.

38. "How long do you plan on staying in Einbroch?" I asked politely.

39. "I'll be here for another 3 days. Don't worry, I won't bother you," he replied, smiling.

40. "No problem. Your presence isn't a problem for me. Since I arrived in this world, I haven't talked to anyone so casually."

41. "Oh, so you're one of the otherworlders?" Balack asked, surprised.

42. 'Otherworlders? Is that what they're calling us?' I confirmed, despite the doubt "yes, I am part of that group of people".

43. "Yes, the otherworlders are usually very depressed. Many talk about the world they came from, and everyone hopes to return, but they say that a giant meteor devastated your world. There are thousands of otherworlders here in Rune Midgard and the Republic of Schwartzvald. We are facing a huge overpopulation crisis all over the world."

44. 'Has the information spread yet?' Things are moving quickly. 'Will any of these former Ragnarok players reveal that this world is actually a game created in our world?' For my part, I will remain silent about it.

45. "Yes, it was exactly as you said. Some of us are having trouble adapting," I replied.
