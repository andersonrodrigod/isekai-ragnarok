As terror spread through the group, everyone reacted differently, but the fear was palpable on everyone's faces. Kaelyn, for example, could barely hold herself together. I could have sworn that if it weren't for the bonds that bound her to the group, she would have run without looking back. Her hands shook slightly as she whispered to herself, in a desperate attempt to contain her nervousness. Elarius, on the other hand, looked like he was about to collapse – his gaze was frantic, his eyes wide and his breathing labored, as if he was already calculating escape routes in case everything got out of control. Even Noctis, usually agile and confident, seemed shaken; his face was pale, his gaze fixed on the surrounding trees, attentive to the Swift Elder Willows' every movement.

Drakon, who was normally the group's unshakable rock, now also showed signs of tension. He clenched his fists around his sword, his face hardened, but in his eyes there was an unusual hesitation. It was clear that the presence of those monsters had surprised him, beyond what he had anticipated. The dense forest around them felt oppressive, and for a brief moment, a wave of panic almost overwhelmed them.

While others faltered, I felt confidence growing within me. The tension in the air was familiar; it was something I knew and controlled well. My focus was absolute and relentless. While they exchanged uncertain looks, I prepared to do what I did best: support the group and take control of the battlefield. No matter how much the situation weighed on them – I would be ready, controlling their every move with precision, being the anchor they needed. (tira esse negócio da confiança do protagonista. deixa ele construir essa confiança no meio da batalha. bota ele pra observar a liderança do Drakon e, ao ver que ele não é muito bom com estratégia, o protagonista passa a liderar o grupo)

With a guttural roar, Azoth charged into battle, his shield gleaming in the moonlight. "Don't worry! I will hold these monsters!" (como assim "eu vou segurar os monstros"? o protagonista é fraco demais pra esses monstros, não? diminui essa confiança dele, não faz sentido)

I took a deep breath, the humid air of that jungle penetrating my lungs. I looked at my companions, each with their expressions of uncertainty, but also with a glimmer of hope in their eyes. "Come on, guys! We can't let these monsters Defeat us!" (genérico, vou mudar depois. melhor falar algo positivo como "a gente consegue"), I exclaimed, my voice echoing between the trees. Raising my shield I drew the attention of one of the trees to me ready to defend at any moment.

Finally, Kaelyn seemed to revive, her eyes shining with renewed determination as she realized the courage she displayed. "I'll buff you with Blessing," (vou mudar pra tipo 'ela só precisava de uma âncora pra recuperar confiança ou algo do tipo) she announced, a wave of confidence coming through her voice. 

"Don't! We have to use our skills smartly," I responded quickly, trying not to let panic dominate the situation.

A wave of concern crossed his gaze as I realized the mistake I was about to make. "First, cast Divine Protection and await my orders." (soou muito repentino o protagonista começar a liderar o grupo do nada) Kaelyn nodded, her expression now more focused, understanding the gravity of the moment.

I looked at Drakon, who was ready for action. "Drakon, I need you to pull the aggro of this Swift Elder Willow. We only need to focus on one of them, so we will organize ourselves into two blocks: Elarius and I will share the aggro of the monster in front of us. But the idea is for everyone to concentrate our attacks on whatever is in your aggro, Drakon." (estranho o protagonista dar ordens ao Drakon. muito repentino)

He nodded, muscles tense in anticipation, and immediately charged towards the monster, pulling aggro effectively. "They're coming! The one with you will get there first. Drakon, Noctis, attack it! Elarius, cast Fire Spear. I'll defend you in the meantime!" The sound of the approaching monster's heavy footsteps echoed like a drum, and the tension in the air became almost unbearable.

When Drakon was hit, he struggled to absorb the damage. Despite his strength, the worry was palpable; two of these small bosses together was a challenge, despite not having the same HP as a main boss (que "main boss" é esse?), they had a stronger attack. The damage dealt to the monster was significant, with Drakon and Noctis dealing powerful blows.

We knew it was possible to find three of them in no time, but we didn't imagine we would have to face two at once. My biggest concern was how we would divide the damage received without anyone dying. The speed of the monsters made any attempt to escape risky, and I soon realized that someone would have to sacrifice themselves if the situation got worse.

During combat, I took the opportunity to add two skill points I had gained to my Mammonite skill, increasing my attack by an impressive 250%. Despite being an expensive move, 300 zeny for each skill used was nothing compared to the situation we were facing. 'I hope I don't waste all my money on this fight', I thought, apprehensively. After I attacked, I managed to deal good damage to the monster.

As soon as Elarius's attack was cast, it released a powerful Fire Spear, hitting the Swift Elder Willow for a massive 305 damage, taking advantage of its elemental weakness. I switched stances with Drakon, allowing him to absorb the other monster's first attack, knowing that, as a swordsman, he had the most HP among us.

The monster we were focusing on had already received several blows and was beginning to show signs of pain; If we continued like this, a few more rounds and we would be able to defeat him. After that, the fight against the last Swift Elder Willow should become much easier.

The battle remained intense, with each movement being executed as if it were part of a deadly choreography. Sensing the need for additional agility, I gave Kaelyn a quick order: "Kaelyn, buff Noctis's agility! We need more speed in his attacks." She nodded, preparing the incantation, while I, in turn, shouted to Elarius, the mage (mage ou wizard? foi chamado de wizard antes), who was now focusing his energy: "Elarius, once again, cast Fire Spear (TROCA TODOS OS "FIRE SPEAR" POR "FIREBOLT" CARAI) on the first Swift Elder Willow! Let's reduce his resistance time (resistance time?) as much as possible."

Before I could give further instructions, Drakon made an unexpected move. He had apparently decided to take an extreme risk by disobeying the instructions I had given (o protagonista fala como se ele fosse o líder do grupo). In a protective impulse, he used the Provoke skill, a risky move that drew the two Swift Elder Willows' attention to him at once. "Damn it, Drakon! What are you doing?" He glanced at me determinedly, his face indicating excessive concern for the group's well-being (isso aqui foi muito idiota, melhor mudar. tem que fazer parecer menos que o Drakon tá fazendo merda/atrapalhando). This impulsive initiative, however, soon placed us in a critical situation. Realizing the risk, I quickly ordered Kaelyn: "Kaelyn, cancel the cast of Increase Agility on Noctis! Cast Urgent Heal on Drakon now!"

While Kaelyn switched her spell to a desperate healing, Noctis, on his turn, used his dagger to attack, and, in a deft move, applied his poison to the most injured Swift Elder Willow, dealing significant continuous damage. Drakon firmly withstood the combined attacks of the two monsters, and, although he had good resistance, the impact of the consecutive blows weakened him visibly. He couldn't keep up this pace for long. I took advantage of an opening and activated Mammonite once again, hitting the monster with 147 direct damage. This was followed by the impact of Elarius's conjured Spear of Fire. Kaelyn's healing finally reached Drakon, restoring some of his vitality, but it was clear that Drakon's risky choice, driven by his protective responsibility (soou mt gay), had placed him in a dangerous situation.

“Drakon, if you don't follow commands, you'll end up dead (alá o protagonista bancando o líder denovo do nada)! We need you alive, it’s crucial for us to defeat these two monsters!” I spoke firmly, hoping to bring his focus back to the plan. Drakon looked up, and for an instant determination flashed across his face; My words seemed to have rekindled hope in him.

I took responsibility for the next attack. “Now it’s my turn to pull aggro!” I shouted towards the injured monster, drawing it towards me. “Drakon, use your strongest attack!” While taking the impact of the blow, Drakon concentrated his power and launched an attack with his Bash skill, consuming a good amount of mana. The blow was destructive, leaving the monster stunned and causing a huge impact. Then, Elarius's Fire Spear spell hit the monster, considerably reducing its vitality.

Drakon, after receiving yet another attack from the second monster, was visibly worried. “We need to get this over with quickly; I’m not going to last much longer like this,” he confessed, his voice cracked with pain. Kaelyn, without hesitation, cast a cure that restored some of his Health, raising his hope. However, he was still only at 180 HP, clearly unable to withstand much more. As for me, my HP was now at 297 after the last hit; I could still resist for a few more moments.

I reinforced the instructions to the group, but then Drakon interrupted me. “I'm going to use a risky Skill... but if it works, we'll finish off the injured monster faster. I will use Magnum Break.” I knew that this skill was powerful, but it consumed both HP and MP, making it very dangerous to the user. I nodded, aware of the risk. While absorbing yet another blow from the injured Swift Elder Willow, I activated Mammonite, dealing an additional impact. I then retreated, allowing Drakon to prepare for the next attack.

A golden aura began to emerge from Drakon, glowing around his body. Noctis, surprised, muttered, "That aura..." before Drakon stepped forward. With both hands firmly gripping his sword, he channeled all his strength into a concentrated strike. As his blade touched the ground, a shockwave pulsed through the ground, cracking the ground and kicking up a cloud of dust. The energy from the strike exploded like a destructive wave, shaking everything around. The air vibrated with the powerful sound of the attack, and we all went wide-eyed as Noctis exclaimed, "He just performed a Critical Hit!" The damage the monster received was 1084.

Swift Elder Willow fell, defeated. There was only one left. The strength of the attack was impressive, almost superhuman for a starting class skill. The golden aura surrounding Drakon seemed unusual, almost otherworldly, which left me intrigued. After the blow, Drakon suffered a slight decline in health, due to the cost of his skill, but upon eliminating the monster, he rose to level 20, completely restoring his HP. Relief coursed through the group; we knew that now it would be easier to face the last enemy.
